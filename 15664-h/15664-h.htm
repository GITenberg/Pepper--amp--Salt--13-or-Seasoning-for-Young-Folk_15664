    <p>Here, my little man, you may hold my cap and
    bells,&mdash;and you, over there, may hold the bauble! Now,
    then, I am ready to talk as a wise man should and am a
    giddy-pated jester no longer!</p>

    <p>This is what I have to say:</p>

    <p>One must have a little pinch of seasoning in this dull,
    heavy life of ours; one should never look to have all the
    troubles, the labors, and the cares, with never a whit of
    innocent jollity and mirth. Yes, one must smile now and then,
    if for nothing else than to lift the corners of the lips in
    laughter that are only too often dragged down in sorrow.</p>

    <p>It is for this that I sit here now, telling you all manner
    of odd quips and jests until yon sober, wise man shakes his
    head and goes his way, thinking that I am even more of a
    shallow-witted knave than I really am. But, prut! Who cares for
    that? I am sure that I do not if you do not.</p>

    <p>Yet listen! One must not look to have nothing but pepper and
    salt in this life of ours&mdash;no, indeed! At that rate we
    would be worse off than we are now. I only mean that it is a
    good and pleasant thing to have something to lend the more
    solid part a little savor now and then!</p>

    <p>So, here I'll sit; and, perhaps, when you have been
    <!-- Page 7 --><a name="Page_7"
       id="Page_7"></a>good children, and have learned your lessons
       or done your work, your mother will let you come and play a
       little while with me. I will always be ready and waiting for
       you here, and I will warrant your mother that I will do you
       no harm with anything that I may tell you. If I can only
       make you laugh and be merry for a little while, then my work
       will be well done, and I will be glad in the doing of
       it.</p>

    <p>And now give me my cap and bells again, for my wits are
    growing cold without them; and you will be pleased to reach me
    my bauble once more, for I love to have him by me.</p>

    <p>Will you be seated? And you, over there, seat the baby on
    the grass! Are you ready? Very well; then I will tell you a
    story, and it shall be about "The Skillful Huntsman."</p><br>

    </div>

    <p>Once upon a time there was a lad named Jacob Boehm, who was
    a practical huntsman.</p>

    <p>One day Jacob said to his mother, "Mother, I would like to
    marry Gretchen&mdash;the nice, pretty little daughter of the
    Herr Mayor."</p>

    <p>Jacob's mother thought that he was crazy. "Marry the
    daughter of the Herr Mayor, indeed! You want to marry the
    daughter of the Herr Mayor? Listen; many a man wants and wants,
    and nothing comes of it!"</p>

    <p>That was what Jacob Boehm's mother said to him.</p>

    <p>But Jacob was deaf in that ear; nothing would do but his
    mother must go to the Herr Mayor, and ask for leave for him to
    marry Gretchen. And Jacob begged and begged so prettily that at
    last his mother promised to go and do as he wished. So off she
    went, though doubt was heavy in her shoes, for she did not know
    how the Herr Mayor would take it.</p>

    <p>"So Jacob wants to marry Gretchen, does he?" said the Herr
    Mayor.</p>

    <p>Yes; that was what Jacob wanted.</p>

    <p>"<!-- Page 17 --><a name="Page_17"
       id="Page_17"></a>And is he a practical huntsman?" said the
       Herr Mayor.</p>

    <p>Oh yes, he was that.</p>

    <p>"So good," said the Herr Mayor. "Then tell Jacob that when
    he is such a clever huntsman as to be able to shoot the
    whiskers off from a running hare without touching the skin,
    then he can have Gretchen."</p><br>

        <p class="caption">"Jacob's Mother &amp; The Herr
        Mayor"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>Then Jacob's mother went back home again. "Now," said she,
    "Jacob will, at least, be satisfied."</p>

    <p>"<!-- Page 18 --><a name="Page_18"
       id="Page_18"></a>Yes," said Jacob, when she had told him all
       that the Herr Mayor had said to her, "that is a hard thing
       to do; but what one man has done, another man can." So he
       shouldered his gun, and started away into the world to learn
       to be as clever a huntsman as the Herr Mayor had said.</p>

    <p>He plodded on and on until at last he fell in with a tall
    stranger dressed all in red.</p>

    <p>"Where are you going, Jacob?" said the tall stranger,
    calling him by his name, just as if he had eaten pottage out of
    the same dish with him.</p>

    <p>"I am going," said Jacob, "to learn to be so clever a
    huntsman that I can shoot the whiskers off from a running hare
    without touching the skin."</p>

    <p>"That is a hard thing to learn," said the tall stranger.</p>

    <p>Yes; Jacob knew that it was a hard thing; but what one man
    had done another man could do.</p>

    <p>"What will you give me if I teach you to be as clever a
    huntsman as that?" said the tall stranger.</p>

    <p>"What will you take to teach me?" said Jacob; for he saw
    that the stranger had a horse's hoof instead of a foot, and he
    did not like his looks, I can tell you.</p>

    <p>"Oh, it is nothing much that I want," said the tall man;
    "only just sign your name to this paper&mdash;that is all."</p>

    <p>But what was in the paper? Yes; Jacob had to know what was
    in the paper before he would set so much as a finger to it.</p>

    <p>Oh, there was nothing in the paper, only this: that when the
    red one should come for Jacob at the end of ten years' time,
    Jacob should promise to go along with him whithersoever he
    should take him.</p>

    <p><!-- Page 19 --><a name="Page_19"
       id="Page_19"></a>At this Jacob hemmed and hawed and
       scratched his head, for he did not know about that. "All the
       same," said he, "I will sign the paper, but on one
       condition."</p><br>

        <p class="caption">"Jacob and The Red One"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>At this the red one screwed up his face as though he had
    sour beer in his mouth, for he did not like the sound of the
    word "condition." "Well," said he, "what is the condition?"</p>

    <p>"It is only this," said Jacob: "that you shall be <i>my</i>
    servant for the ten years, and if, in all that time, I should
    <!-- Page 20 --><a name="Page_20"
       id="Page_20"></a><!-- Page 21 -->chance to ask you a
       question that you cannot answer, then I am to be my own man
       again."</p>

    <p>Oh, if that was all, the red man was quite willing for
    that.</p>

    <p>Then he took Jacob's gun, and blew down into the barrel of
    it. "Now," said he, "you are as skillful a huntsman as you
    asked to be."</p>

    <p>"That I must try," said Jacob. So Jacob and the red one went
    around hunting here and hunting there until they scared up a
    hare. "Shoot!" said the red one; and Jacob shot. Clip! off flew
    the whiskers of the hare as neatly as one could cut them off
    with the barber's shears.</p>

    <p>"Yes, good!" said Jacob, "now I am a skillful huntsman."</p>

    <p>Then the stranger in red gave Jacob a little bone whistle,
    and told him to blow in it whenever he should want him. After
    that Jacob signed the paper, and the stranger went one way and
    he went home again.</p>

    <p>Well, Jacob brushed the straws off from his coat, and put a
    fine shine on his boots, and then he set off to the Herr
    Mayor's house.</p>

    <p>"How do you find yourself, Jacob?" said the Herr Mayor.</p>

    <p>"So good," said Jacob.</p>

    <p>"And are you a skillful huntsman now?" said the Herr
    Mayor.</p>

    <p>Oh yes, Jacob was a skillful huntsman now.</p>

    <p>Yes, good! But the Herr Mayor must have proof of that. Now,
    could Jacob shoot a feather out of the tail of the magpie
    flying over the trees yonder?</p>

    <p>Oh yes! nothing easier than that. So Jacob raised the gun to
    his cheek. Bang! went the gun, and down fell a feather from the
    tail of the magpie. At this the Herr Mayor stared and stared,
    for he had never seen such shooting.</p>

    <p>"And now may I marry Gretchen?" said
          Jacob.</p><a name="Page_21"

        <p class="caption">"Jacob shoots at the Magpie"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>At this the Herr Mayor scratched his head, and hemmed and
    hawed. No; Jacob could not marry Gretchen yet, for he had
    always said and sworn that the man who should marry Gretchen
    should bring with him a plough that could go of itself, and
    plough three furrows at once. If Jacob would show him such a
    plough as <!-- Page 24 --><a name="Page_24"
       id="Page_24"></a>that, then he might marry Gretchen and
       welcome. That was what the Herr Mayor said.</p>

    <p>Jacob did not know how about that; perhaps he could get such
    a plough, perhaps he could not. If such a plough was to be had,
    though, he would have it. So off he went home again, and the
    Herr Mayor thought that he was rid of him now for sure and
    certain.</p>

    <p>But when Jacob had come home, he went back of the woodpile
    and blew a turn or two on the little bone whistle that the red
    stranger had given him. No sooner had he done this than the
    other stood before him as suddenly as though he had just
    stepped out of the door of nowheres.</p>

    <p>"What do you want, Jacob?" said he.</p>

    <p>"I would like," said Jacob, "to have a plough that can go by
    itself and plough three furrows at once."</p>

    <p>"That you shall have," said the red one. Then he thrust his
    hand into his breeches pocket, and drew forth the prettiest
    little plough that you ever saw. He stood it on the ground
    before Jacob, and it grew large as you see it in the picture.
    "Plough away," said he, and then he went back again whither he
    had come.</p>

    <p>So Jacob laid his hands to the plough
    and&mdash;whisk!&mdash;away it went like John Stormwetter's
    colt, with Jacob behind it. Out of the farm-yard they went, and
    down the road, and so to the Herr Mayor's house, and behind
    them lay three fine brown furrows, smoking in the sun.</p>

    <p>When the Herr Mayor saw them coming he opened his eyes, you
    may be sure, for he had never seen such a plough as that in all
    of his life before.</p>

    <p>"<!-- Page 25 --><a name="Page_25"
       id="Page_25"></a>And now," said Jacob, "I should like to
       marry Gretchen, if you please."</p>

    <p>At this the Herr Mayor hemmed and hawed and scratched his
    head again. No; Jacob could not marry Gretchen yet, for the
    Herr Mayor had always said and sworn that the man who married
    Gretchen should bring with him a purse that always had two
    pennies in it and could never be emptied, no matter how much
    was taken out of it.</p><!-- Page 23 --><a name="Page_23"

        <p class="caption">"Jacob and the Magic Plough"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>Jacob did not know how about that; perhaps he could get it
    and perhaps he could not. If such a thing was to be had,
    though, he would have it, as sure as the Mecklenburg folks brew
    sour beer. So off he went home again, and the Herr Mayor
    thought that now he was rid of him for certain.</p>

    <p>But Jacob went back of the woodpile and blew on his bone
    whistle again, and once more the red one came at his
    bidding.</p>

    <p>"What will you have now?" said he to Jacob.</p>

    <p>"<!-- Page 26 --><a name="Page_26"
       id="Page_26"></a>I should like," said Jacob, "to have a
       purse which shall always have two pennies in it, no matter
       how much I take out of it."</p>

    <p>"That you shall have," said the red one; whereupon he thrust
    his hand into his pocket, and fetched out a beautiful silken
    purse with two pennies in it. He gave the purse to Jacob, and
    then he went away again as quickly as he had come.</p>

    <p>After he had gone, Jacob began taking pennies out of his
    purse and pennies out of his purse, until he had more than a
    hatful&mdash;hui! I would like to have such a purse as
    that.</p>

    <p>Then he marched off to the Herr Mayor's house with his chin
    up, for he might hold his head as high as any, now that he had
    such a purse as that in his pocket. As for the Herr Mayor, he
    thought that it was a nice, pretty little purse; but could it
    do this and that as he had said?</p>

    <p>Jacob would show him that; so he began taking pennies and
    pennies out of it, until he had filled all the pots and pans in
    the house with them. And now might he marry Gretchen?</p>

    <p>Yes; that he might! So said the Herr Mayor; for who would
    not like to have a lad for a son-in-law who always had two
    pennies more in his purse than he could spend.</p>

    <p>So Jacob married his Gretchen, and, between his plough and
    his purse, he was busy enough, I can tell you.</p>

    <p>So the days went on and on and on until the ten
    <!-- Page 27 --><a name="Page_27"
       id="Page_27"></a>years had gone by and the time had come for
       the red one to fetch Jacob away with him. As for Jacob, he
       was in a sorry state of dumps, as you may well believe.</p>

    <p>At last Gretchen spoke to him. "See, Jacob," said she, "what
    makes you so down in the mouth?"</p>

    <p>"Oh! nothing at all," said Jacob.</p>

    <p>But this did not satisfy Gretchen, for she could see that
    there was more to be told than Jacob had spoken. So she teased
    and teased, until at last Jacob told her all, and that the red
    one was to come the next day and take him off as his servant,
    unless he could ask him a question which he could not
    answer.</p>

    <p>"Prut!" said Gretchen, "and is that all? Then there is no
    stuffing to that sausage, for I can help you out of your
    trouble easily enough." Then she told Jacob that when the next
    day should come he should do thus and so, and she would do this
    and that, and between them they might cheat the red one after
    all.</p>

    <p>So, when the next day came, Gretchen went into the pantry
    and smeared herself all over with honey. Then she ripped open a
    bed and rolled herself in the feathers.</p>

    <p>By-and-by came the red one. Rap! tap! tap! he knocked at the
    door.</p>

    <p>"Are you ready to go with me now, Jacob?" said he.</p>

    <p>Yes; Jacob was quite ready to go, only he would like to have
    one favor granted him first.</p>

    <p>"What is it that you want?" said the red one.</p>

    <p>"Only this," said Jacob: "I would like to shoot one more
    shot out of my old gun before I go with you."</p>

    <p><!-- Page 28 --><a name="Page_28"
       id="Page_28"></a>Oh, if that was all, he might do that and
       welcome. So Jacob took down his gun, and he and the red one
       went out together, walking side by side, for all the world
       as though they were born brothers.</p><br>

    <p>By-and-by they saw a wren. "Shoot at that," said the red
    one.</p>

    <p>"Oh no," said Jacob, "that is too small."</p>

    <p>So they went on a little farther.</p>

    <p>By-and-by they saw a raven. "Shoot at that, then," said the
    red one.</p>

    <p>"Oh no," said Jacob, "that is too black."</p>

    <p><!-- Page 29 -->So they went on a little farther.</p>

    <p>By-and-by they came to a ploughed field, and there was
    something skipping over the furrows that looked for all the
    world like a great bird. That was Gretchen; for the feathers
    stuck to the honey and all over her, so that she looked just
    like a great bird.</p>

    <p>"Shoot at that! shoot at that!" said the red one, clapping
    his hands together.</p>

    <p>"Oh yes," said Jacob, "I will shoot at that." So he raised
    his gun and took aim. Then he lowered his gun again. "But what
    is it?" said he.</p>

    <p>At this the red one screwed up his eyes, and looked and
    looked, but for the life of him he could not tell what it
    was.</p>

    <p>"No matter what it is," said he, "only shoot and be done
    with it, for I must be going."</p>

    <p>"Yes, good! But what <i>is</i> it?" said Jacob.</p>

    <p>Then the red one looked and looked again, but he could tell
    no better this time than he could before. "It may be this and
    it may be that," said he. "Only shoot and be done with it, for
    they are waiting for me at home."</p>

    <p>"Yes, my friend," said Jacob, "that is all very good; only
    tell me what it is and I will shoot."</p>

    <p>"Thunder and lightning!" bawled the red one, <i>"I do not
    know what it is!"</i></p>

    <p>"Then be off with you!" said Jacob, "for, since you cannot
    answer my question, all is over between us two."</p>

    <p>At this the red one had to leave Jacob, so he fled away over
    hill and dale, bellowing like a bull.</p>

    <p>As for Jacob and Gretchen, they went back home together,
    very well pleased with each other and themselves.</p>

    <p>And the meaning of all this is, that many another<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">man beside Jacob Boehm would
    find himself</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">in a pretty scrape only for

    <h2>TWO OPINIONS</h2><span style="margin-left: 4em;">(Ye first
    opinion)</span><br>
    <br>
     A noisy chattering Magpie once<br>
     A talking gabbling hairbrained dunce<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came by where a sign-post
    stood.</span><br>
     He nodded his head with a modish air<br>
     And said "good day" for he wasn't aware<br>
     That the sign-post pointing its finger there<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was only a block of
    wood.</span><br>
    <br>
     Quoth he, "An exceedingly sultry day.<br>
     T'is more like June than the first of May."<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The post said never a
    word.</span><br>
     "I've just dropped over from Lincolnshire.<br>
     My home is in the Cathedral Spire&mdash;<br>
     The air is cooler and purer the higher<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">You get&mdash;as you've
    doubtless heard."</span><br>
    <br>
     So on he chattered with never a stop,<br>
     And on and on till you'd think he would drop.<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">(The post was dumb as your
    hat.)</span><br>
     But so as the pie could say his say<br>
     He didn't care whether it spoke all day;<br>
     For thus he observed as he walked away&mdash;<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"An intelligent creature
    that."</span><br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">(Ye second opinion)</span><br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now once when the sky was
    pouring rain,</span><br>
     The Magpie chanced to come by again&mdash;<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there stood the post in
    the wet.</span><br>
     "Helloa." said the Magpie. "What you here<br>
     Pray tell me I beg is there sheltering near&mdash;<br>
     A terrible day for this time of the year.<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">T'would make a Saint Anthony
    fret."</span><br>
    <br>
     "I beg your pardon&mdash;I didn't quite hear."<br>
     (Then louder) "I say is there sheltering near"<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the post was as dumb as
    Death.</span><br>
     "What can't you answer a question pray<br>
     You will not&mdash;No&mdash;Then I'll say good-day."<br>
     And flirting his tail he walked away.<br>
     "You'r a fool." (this under his breath.)<br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">L'ENVOY</span><br>

    <h2>Ye song of ye foolish old woman.</h2>

    <p>I saw an old woman go up a steep hill,<br>
     And she chuckled and laughed, as she went, with a will.<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And yet, as she
    went,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her body was bent,</span><br>
     With a load as heavy as sins in Lent.<br>
    <br>
     "Oh! why do you chuckle, old woman;" says I,<br>
     "As you climb up the hill-side so steep and so high?"<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Because, don't you
    see,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">I'll presently

     At the top of the hill. He! he!" says she.<br>
    <br>
     I saw the old woman go downward again;<br>
     And she easily travelled, with never a pain;<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yet she loudly
    cried,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And gustily sighed,</span><br>
     And groaned, though the road was level and wide.<br>
    <br>
     "Oh! why, my old woman," says I, "do you weep,<br>
     When you laughed, as you climbed up the hill-side so
    steep?"<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">"High-ho! I am
    vexed,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Because I
    expects,"</span><br>
     Says she, "I shall ache in climbing the next."<br>

     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">In a lone seclusion hid;
    "Oh,</span><br>
     Here is luck!" the tailor said, "and here I'll stay."<br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">So the baker jogged
    along,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">All alone, with ne'er a
    song,</span><br>
     Or a jest; and nothing tempted him to stay.<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">But he went from bad to
    worse,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">For he never found the

     And for all I know he is wandering to this day.<br>

    </div>

    <p>Hans and Claus were born brothers. Hans was the elder and
    Claus was the younger; Hans was the richer and Claus was the
    poorer&mdash;that is the way that the world goes sometimes.</p>

    <p>Everything was easy for Hans at home; he drank much beer,
    and had sausages and white bread three times a day; but Claus
    worked and worked, and no luck came of it&mdash;that, also, is
    the way that the world goes sometimes.</p>

    <p>One time Claus spoke to Hans of this matter. "See, Hans,"
    said he, "you should give me some money, for that which belongs
    to one brother should help the other."</p>

    <p>But Hans saw through different colored spectacles than
    Claus. No; he would do nothing of the kind. If Claus wanted
    money he had better go out into, the world to look for it; for
    some folks said that money was rolling about in the wide world
    like peas on a threshing-floor. So said Hans, for Claus was so
    poor that Hans was ashamed of him, and wanted him to leave home
    so as to be rid of him for good and all.</p>

    <p>This was how Claus came to go out into the world.</p>

    <p>But before he went, he cut himself a good stout staff of
    hazel-wood to help his heavy feet over the road.</p>

    <p><!-- Page 34 --><a name="Page_34"
       id="Page_34"></a>Now the staff that Claus had cut was a rod
       of witch-hazel, which has the power of showing wherever
       treasure lies buried. But Claus knew no more of that than
       the chick in the shell.</p>

    <p>So off he went into the world, walking along with great
    contentment, kicking up little clouds of dust at every step,
    and whistling as gayly as though trouble had never been hatched
    from mares' eggs. By-and-by he came to the great town, and then
    he went to the market-place and stood, with many others, with a
    straw in his mouth&mdash;for that meant that he wanted to take
    service with somebody.</p>

    <p>Presently there came along an old, old man, bent almost
    double with the weight of the years which he carried upon his
    shoulders. This was a famous doctor of the black-arts. He had
    read as many as a hundred books, so that he was more learned
    than any man in all of the world&mdash;even the minister of the
    village. He knew, as well as the birds know when the cherries
    are ripe, that Claus had a stick of witch-hazel, so he came to
    the market-place, peering here and peering there, just as
    honest folks do when they are looking for a servant. After a
    while he came to where Claus was, and then he stopped in front
    of him. "Do you want to take service, my friend?" said he.</p>

    <p>Yes, that was what Claus wanted; why else should he stand in
    the market-place with a straw in his mouth?</p>

    <p>Well, they bargained and bargained, and talked and talked,
    and the end of the matter was that Claus agreed to sell his
    services to the old master of black-arts for seven pennies a
    week. So they made their bargain, and off went the master with
    Claus at his heels. After they had <!-- Page 35 --><a name=
    "Page_35"
       id="Page_35"></a><!-- Page 36 --><a name="Page_36"
       id="Page_36"></a><!-- Page 38 --><a name="Page_38"
       id="Page_38"></a>come a little distance away from the crowd
       at the marketplace, the master of black-arts asked Claus
       where he had got that fine staff of hazel.</p><br>


    <div class="ctr">
        <a id="Master_of_Black-Arts"></a> <a href=

             title="Claus and the Master of Black-Arts"></a>

        <p class="caption">"Claus and the Master of Black-Arts"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>"Oh, I got it over yonder," said Claus, pointing with his
    thumb.</p>

    <p>But could he find the place again?</p>

    <p>Well, Claus did not know how about that; perhaps he could,
    and perhaps he could not.</p>

    <p>But suppose that Claus had a thaler in his hand, <i>then</i>
    could he find the place again?</p>

    <p>Oh yes; in that case Claus was almost sure that he could
    find the place again.</p>

    <p>So good. Then here was a bottle of yellow water. If Claus
    would take the bottle of yellow water, and pour it over the
    stump from which he had cut his staff, there would come seven
    green snakes out of a hole at the foot of the hazel-bush. After
    these seven snakes, there would come a white snake, with a
    golden crown on its head, from out of the same hole. Now if
    Claus would catch that white snake in the empty bottle, and
    bring it to the master of black-arts, he should have not one
    thaler, but two&mdash;that was what the master said.</p>

    <p>Oh yes, Claus could do that; that was no such hard thing. So
    he took the bottle of yellow water and off he went.</p>

    <p>By-and-by he came to the place where he had cut his
    hazel-twig. There he did as the master of black-arts had told
    him; he poured the yellow water over the stump of hazel from
    which he had cut his staff. Then everything happened just as
    the other had said: first there came seven green snakes out of
    the hole at the foot of the hazel-bush,
       <!-- Page 39 --><a name="Page_39"
       id="Page_39"></a>and after they had all gone, there came a
       white snake, with a little golden crown on its head, and
       with its body gleaming like real silver. Then Claus caught
       the white snake, and put it into the bottle and corked it up
       tightly. After he had done this he went back to the master
       of black-arts again.</p>

    <p>Now this white snake was what the folk call a tomtsnake in
    that land. Whoever eats of a broth made of it can understand
    the language of all the birds of the air and all the beasts of
    the field; so nobody need wonder that the master was as glad as
    glad could be to have his white snake safe and sound.</p><br>


    <div class="ctr">
        <a id="White_Snake"></a> <a href=

             title="Claus and the White Snake"></a>

        <p class="caption">"Claus and the White Snake"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>He bade Claus build a fire of dry wood, and as soon as there
    was a good blaze he set a pot of water upon it to boil. When
    the water in the pot began to boil, he chopped up the white
    snake into little pieces and threw them into it. So the snake
    boiled and boiled and boiled, and Claus stared with wonder as
    though he would never shut his eyes again.</p>

    <p>Now it happened that just about the time that the broth was
    cooked, the master was called out of the room for this or for
    that. No sooner was his back turned than Claus began to wonder
    what the broth was like. "I will just have a little taste,"
    said he to himself; "surely it can do no harm to the rest of
    the soup." So he stuck his <!-- Page 40 --><a name="Page_40"
       id="Page_40"></a>finger first into the broth and then into
       his mouth; but what the broth tasted like he never could
       tell, for just then the master came in again, and Claus was
       so frightened at what he had done that he had no wits to
       think of the taste of anything.</p>

    <p>Presently the master of black-arts went to the pot of broth,
    and, taking off the lid, began smelling of it. But no sooner
    had he sniffed a smell of the steam than he began thumping his
    head with his knuckles, and tearing his hair, and stamping his
    feet. "<i>Somebody's had a finger in my broth!!!</i>" he
    roared. For the master knew at once that all the magic had been
    taken out of it by the touch of Claus's finger.</p>

    <p>As for poor Claus, he was so frightened that he fell upon
    his knees, and began begging: "Oh! dear master&mdash;" But he
    got no further than this, for the master bawled at him,</p>

    <p>"You have taken the best,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You may have the
    rest."</span></p>

    <p>And so saying, he threw pot and broth and all at Claus, so
    that if he hadn't ducked his head he might have been scalded to
    death. Then Claus ran out into the street, for he saw that
    there was no place for him to stay in that house.</p>

    <p>Now in the street there was a cock and a hen, scratching and
    clucking together in the dust, and Claus understood every word
    that they said to each other, so he stopped and listened to
    them.</p>

    <p>This is what they said:</p>

    <p><!-- Page 41 --><a name="Page_41"
       id="Page_41"></a>The cock said to the hen, "Yonder goes our
       new serving-man."</p>

    <p>And the hen said to the cock, "Yes, yonder he goes."</p>

    <p>And the cock said to the hen, "He is leaving the best behind
    him."</p><br>


    <div class="ctr">

        <p class="caption">"THE MASTER IS ANGRY"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>And the hen said to the cock, "What is it that he is
    leaving?"</p>

    <p>And the cock said to the hen, "He is leaving behind him the
    witch-hazel staff that he brought with him."</p>

    <p>And the hen said to the cock, "Yes, that is so. He
    <!-- Page 42 --><a name="Page_42"
       id="Page_42"></a>would be a fool to leave that behind, yet
       he is not the first one to think that peas are pebbles."</p>

    <p>As for Claus, you can guess how he opened his eyes, for he
    saw how the land lay, and that he had other ears than he had
    before.</p>

    <p>"Hui!" said he, "that is good! I have bought more for my
    penny than I had in my bargain."</p>

    <p>As for the hazel staff, he was not going to leave that
    behind, you may be sure. So he sneaked about the place till he
    laid hand on it again; then he stepped away, right foot
    foremost, for he did not know what the master of black-arts
    might do to him if he should catch him.</p>

    <p>Well, after he had left the town, he went along, tramp!
    tramp! tramp! until, by-and-by, he grew tired and sat down
    beneath an oak-tree to rest himself.</p><br>

        <p class="caption">"Claus listens to the talk of the two
        ravens"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>Now, as he sat there, looking up through the leaves,
    thinking of nothing at all, two ravens came flying and lit in
    the tree above him. After a while the ravens began talking
    together, and this was what they said:</p>

    <p><!-- Page 43 --><a name="Page_43"
       id="Page_43"></a>The one raven said, "Yonder is poor Claus
       sitting below us."</p>

    <p>And the other raven said, "<i>Poor</i> Claus, did you say,
    brother? Do you not see the witch-hazel lying on the ground
    beside him?"</p>

    <p>The one raven said, "Oh yes; I see that, but what good does
    it do him?"</p>

    <p>And the other raven said, "It does him no good now, but if
    he were to go home again and strike on the great stone on the
    top of the hill back of Herr Axel's house, then it would do him
    good; for in it lies a great treasure of silver and gold."</p>

    <p>Claus had picked up his ears at all this talk, you may be
    sure. "See," said he, "that is the way that a man will pass by
    a great fortune in the little world at home to seek for a
    little fortune in the great world abroad"&mdash;which was all
    very true. After that he lost no time in getting back home
    again.</p>

    <p>"What! are you back again?" said Hans.</p>

    <p>"Oh yes," said Claus, "I am back again."</p>

    <p>"That is always the way with a pewter penny," said
    Hans&mdash;for that is how some of us are welcomed home after
    we have been away.</p>

    <p>As for Claus, he was as full of thoughts as an egg is of
    meat, but he said nothing of them to Hans. Off he went to the
    high hill back of Herr Axel's house, and there, sure enough,
    was the great stone at the very top of the hill.</p>

    <p>Claus struck on the stone with his oaken staff, and it
    opened like the door of a beer vault, for all was blackness
    within. A flight of steps led down below, and down the steps
    Claus went. But when he had come to the bottom
    <!-- Page 44 --><a name="Page_44"
       id="Page_44"></a>of the steps, he stared till his eyes were
       like great round saucers; for there stood sacks of gold and
       silver, piled up like bags of grain in the
       malt-house.</p><br>


    <div class="ctr">
        <a id="Manikin"></a> <a href=
        "images/clausmanikinfull.png"><img src=
        "images/clausmanikinthumb.png"
             alt="Claus and the Manikin"
             title="Claus and the Manikin"></a>

        <p class="caption">"Claus and the Manikin"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>At one end of the room was a great stone seat, and on the
    seat sat a little manikin smoking a pipe. As for the beard of
    the little man, it was as long as he was short, for it hung
    down so far that part of it touched the stone floor.</p>

    <p>"How do you find yourself, Claus?" said the little manikin,
    calling Claus by his name.</p>

    <p>"So good!" said Claus, taking off his hat to the other.</p>

    <p>"And what would you like to have, Claus?" said the little
    man.</p>

    <p>"<!-- Page 45 --><a name="Page_45"
       id="Page_45"></a>I would like," said Claus, "to have some
       money, if you please."</p>

    <p>"Take what you want," said the little man, "only do not
    forget to take the best with you."</p>

    <p>Oh no; Claus would not forget the best; so he held the staff
    tighter than ever in his fist&mdash;for what could be better
    than the staff that brought him there? So he went here and
    there, filling his pockets with the gold and silver money till
    they bulged out like the pockets of a thief in the orchard; but
    all the time he kept tight hold of his staff, I can tell
    you.</p>

    <p>When he had as much as his pockets could hold, he thanked
    the little manikin and went his way, and the stone door closed
    behind him.</p>

    <p>And now Claus lived like a calf in the green corn-field.
    Everything he had was of the best, and he had twice as much of
    that as any of the neighbors. Then how brother Hans stared and
    scratched his head and wondered, when he saw how Claus sat in
    the sun all day, doing nothing but smoking his pipe and eating
    of the best, as though he were a born prince! Every day Claus
    went to the little man in the hill with his pockets empty, and
    came back with them stuffed with gold and silver money. At last
    he had so much that he could not count it, and so he had to
    send over to brother Hans for his quart-pot, so that he might
    measure it.</p>

    <p>But Hans was cunning. "I will see what makes brother Claus
    so well-off in the world all of a sudden," said he; so he
    smeared the inside of the quart-pot with bird-lime.</p>

    <p><!-- Page 46 --><a name="Page_46"
       id="Page_46"></a>Then Claus measured his gold and silver
       money in Hans's quart-pot, and when he was done with it he
       sent it back again. But more went back with the quart-pot
       than came with it, for two gold-pieces stuck to the
       birdlime, and it was these that went back with the pot to
       brother Hans.</p><br>


    <div class="ctr">

             title="Hans discovers Claus's Luck"></a>

        <p class="caption">"Hans discovers Claus's Luck"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>"What!" cried Hans, "has that stupid Claus found so much
    money that he has to measure it in a quart-pot? We must see the
    inside of this business!" So off he went to Claus's house, and
    there he found Claus sitting in the sun and smoking his pipe,
    just as though he owned all of the world.</p>

    <p>"Where did you get all that money, Claus?" said Hans.</p>

    <p>Oh! Claus could not tell him that.</p>

    <p>But Hans was bound to know all about it, so he begged and
    begged so prettily that at last Claus had to tell him
    everything. Then, of course, nothing would do but Hans must
    have a try with the hazel staff also.</p>

    <p>Well, Claus made no words at that. He was a good-natured
    fellow, and surely there was enough for both. So the upshot of
    the matter was that Hans marched off with the hazel staff.</p>

    <p><!-- Page 47 --><a name="Page_47"
       id="Page_47"></a>But Hans was no such simpleton as Claus;
       no, not he. Oh no, he would not take all that trouble for
       two poor pocketfuls of money. He would have a bagful; no, he
       would have <i>two</i> bagfuls. So he slung two meal sacks
       over his shoulder, and off he started for the hill back of
       Herr Axel's house.</p>

    <p>When he came to the stone he knocked upon it, and it opened
    to him just as it had done for Claus. Down he went into the
    pit, and there sat the little old manikin, just as he had done
    from the very first.</p>

    <p>"How do you find yourself, Hans?" said the little old
    manikin.</p>

    <p>Oh, Hans found himself very well. Might he have some of the
    money that stood around the room in the sacks?</p>

    <p>Yes, that he might; only remember to take the best away with
    him.</p>

    <p>Prut! teach a dog to eat sausages. Hans would see that he
    took the best, trust him for that. So he filled the bags full
    of gold, and never touched the silver&mdash;for, surely, gold
    is better than anything else in the world, says Hans to
    himself. So, when he had filled his two bags with gold, and had
    shaken the pieces well down, he flung the one over one
    shoulder, and the other over the other, and then he had as much
    as he could carry. As for the staff of witch-hazel, he let it
    lie where it was, for he only had two hands and they were both
    full.</p>

    <p>But Hans never got his two bags of gold away from the vault,
    for just as he was leaving&mdash;bang! came the stone together,
    and caught him as though he was a mouse
       <!-- Page 48 --><a name="Page_48"
       id="Page_48"></a>in the door; and that was an end of him.
       That happened because he left the witch-hazel behind.</p>

    <p>That was the way in which Claus came to lose his magic
    staff; but that did not matter much, for he had enough to live
    on and to spare. So he married the daughter of the Herr Baron
    (for he might marry whom he chose, now that he was rich), and
    after that he lived as happy as a fly on the warm chimney.</p>

    <p>Now, <i>this</i> is so&mdash;it is better to take a little
    away at a<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">time and carry your staff with
    you, than to</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">take all at once and leave it
    behind.</span></p>

    <h2>VENTURESOME BOLDNESS</h2>

    <p>A tailor came a-walking by,<br>
     The fire of courage in his eye.<br>
     "Where are you going Sir?" Said I.<br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">"I slew a mouse</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">In our house</span><br>
     Where other tailors live," said he,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">"And not a Jack</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Among the pack</span><br>
     Would dare to do the like; pardie!<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therefore, I'm going out to
    try</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">If there be greater men that
    I;</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Or in the land</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">As bold a hand</span><br>
     At wielding brand as I, you see!"<br>
    <br>
     The tailor came a-limping by<br>
     With woful face and clothes awry<br>
     And all his courage gone to pie.<br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">"I met a knight</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">In armor bright</span><br>
     And bade him stand and draw," said he;<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">"He straightaway
    did</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">As he was bid,</span><br>
     And treated me outrageously.<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">So I shall get me home
    again,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And probably shall there
    remain.</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">A little man.</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Sir, always can</span><br>
     Be great with folk of less degree!"<br>

    <h2>SUPERFICIAL CULTURE</h2>

    <p>I'll tell of a certain old dame;<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">The same</span><br>
     Had a beautiful piggy, whose name<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Was James;</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">and whose beauty and
    worth,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the day of his
    birth,</span><br>
     Were matters of popular fame,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">And his claim</span><br>
     To gentility no one could blame.<br>
    <br>
     So, seeing his promise, she thought<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">She ought</span><br>
     To have him sufficiently taught<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">The art</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of deportment, to
    go</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into company; so</span><br>
     A master of dancing she brought,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Who was fraught</span><br>
     With a style which the piggiwig caught.<br>
    <br>
     So his company manners were rare.<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">His care</span><br>
     Of social observances there<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Would bear</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The closest
    inspection,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And not a
    reflection</span><br>
     Could rest on his actions, howe'er<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">You might care</span><br>
     To examine 'em down to a hair.<br>
    <br>
     Now, things went beau-ti-ful-ly,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Till he</span><br>
     Fell in love with a dame of degree;<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Pardie!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he tried for to
    speak,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">But could only say, "O
    w-e-e-k!"</span><br>
     For, whatever his polish might be,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Why, dear me!</span><br>
     He was pig at the bottom, you see.<br>

    </div>

    <p>If one could always hold one's tongue as to what one sees,
    one would be the better for it. They are the wise people of
    this world who keep silence as to what they see; many such
    there are who behold things such as neither you nor I may ever
    hope to look upon, and yet we know nothing of this because they
    say nothing of it, going their own ways like common folks, and
    as though they saw nothing in an egg but the meat.</p>

    <p>Dame Margery Twist of Tavistock town was not one of these
    wise folks who hold their tongues; she was a good, gossiping,
    chattering old soul, whose hen never hatched a chick but all of
    the neighbors knew of it, as the saying goes. The poor old
    creature had only one eye; how she lost the other you shall
    presently hear, and also how her wonderful tulip garden became
    like anybody else's tulip garden.</p>

    <p>Dame Margery Twist lived all alone with a great tabby cat.
    She dwelt in a little cottage that stood back from the road,
    and just across the way from the butcher's shop. All within was
    as neat and as bright as a new pin, so that it was a delight
    just to look upon the row <!-- Page 50 --><a name="Page_50"
       id="Page_50"></a>of blue dishes upon the dresser, the pewter
       pipkins as bright as silver, or the sanded floor, as clean
       as your mother's table. Over the cottage twined sweet
       woodbines, so that the air was ladened with their fragrance
       in the summer-time, when the busy, yellow-legged bees droned
       amid the blossoms from the two hives that stood along
       against the wall. But the wonder of the garden was the tulip
       bed, for there were no tulips in all England like them, and
       folks came from far and near, only to look upon them and to
       smell their fragrance. They stood in double rows, and were
       of all colors&mdash;white, yellow, red, purple, and pied.
       They bloomed early, and lasted later than any others, and,
       when they were in flower, all the air was filled with their
       perfume.</p>

    <p>Now all of these things happened before the smoke of the
    factories and the rattling of the steam-cars had driven the
    fairy folks away from this world into No-man's-land, and this
    was the secret of the dame's fine tulip bed. For the fairies
    dwelt among the flowers, and she often told her gossips how
    that she could hear the fairy mothers singing their babies to
    sleep at night, when the moon was full and the evening was
    warm. She had never seen the little folks herself, for few
    folks are given to look upon them, and Dame Margery's eyes were
    not of that nature. Nevertheless, she heard them, and that, in
    my opinion, is the next best thing to seeing them.</p>

    <p>Dame Margery Twist, as I said, was a good, kind, comfortable
    old soul, and was, moreover, the best nurse in all of Tavistock
    town. Was any one ill, it was Dame <!-- Page 51 --><a name=
    "Page_51"
       id="Page_51"></a>Margery who was called upon to attend him;
       as for the dame herself, she was always ready to bring a
       sick body into good health again, and was always paid well
       for the nursing.</p><br>

        <p class="caption">"DAME TWIST DRINKETH TEA"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>One evening the dame was drinking her tea by herself with
    great comfort. It was just at the dusking of the twilight; the
    latticed window was opened, so that the little breezes came
    rushing into the room, or stayed a while to play wantonly with
    the white linen curtains. The tabby cat was purring in the
    door-way, and the dame was enjoying the sweetness of the
    summer-time. There <!-- Page 52 --><a name="Page_52"
       id="Page_52"></a>came a knock at the door, "Who is it?" said
       Dame Margery.</p>

    <p>"It's Tommy Lamb, if you please, ma'am," said a little
    voice.</p>

    <p>"Come in, Tommy," said the dame.</p>

    <p>So in came Tommy Lamb, a little, curly-headed fellow, not
    any older than you, "What is it you want, Tommy?" said the
    dame.</p>

    <p>"If you please, ma'am, there's a little gentleman outside,
    no taller than I be; he gave me this box, and told me to tell
    you to rub your eyes with the salve and then to come out to
    him."</p>

    <p>The dame looked out of the window, but never a body stood
    there that she could see. "Where is the gentleman, dearie?"
    said she.</p>

    <p>"Yonder he is, with a great white horse standing beside
    him," said Tommy Lamb, and he pointed with his finger as he
    spoke.</p>

    <p>The dame rubbed her eyes and looked again, but never a thing
    did she see but the green gate, the lilac-bushes, and the
    butcher's shop opposite. The truth of the matter is, that
    little children like you, my dear, see things which we grown
    folks, with the dust of the world in our eyes, may never
    behold. "Well," said Dame Margery to herself, "this is strange,
    for sure! <i>I</i> see no little old gentleman in green." Then
    she opened the box that she held, and looked into it and saw
    that it was filled with a green salve. "I'll rub some of it on
    my eyes, at any rate," said she; whereupon she did so. Then she
    looked again, and, lo and behold! there stood a little old man,
    no taller than Tommy Lamb. His face <!-- Page 53 --><a name=
    "Page_53"
       id="Page_53"></a><!-- Page 56 --><a name="Page_56"
       id="Page_56"></a>was as brown, and as withered, and as
       wrinkled as a winter's crab-apple left on the bare tree when
       the frost is about. He was dressed all in green from top to
       toe, and on his head was a tall green cap, with a bell at
       the peak, which tinkled at every movement of his head. By
       his side stood a great, tall, milk-white horse, with a long
       tail and mane tied with party-colored ribbons.</p><br>


    <div class="ctr">
        <a id="THE_LITTLE_MAN"></a> <a href=

             title="THE LITTLE MAN AND THE GREAT HORSE"></a>

        <p class="caption">"THE LITTLE MAN AND THE GREAT HORSE"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>Dame Margery went out to the little old gentleman in green,
    and asked him what he would have with her. He told the dame
    that his wife was sorely sick, and that he wanted her to come
    and nurse her for the night. At this Dame Margery hemmed and
    hawed and shook her head, for she did not like the thought of
    going out at night, she knew not where, and with such a strange
    little body. Then the little man begged her and pleaded with
    her, and his voice and his words were as sweet as honey. At
    last he persuaded her to go, promising her a good reward if she
    would nurse his wife back into her health again. So the dame
    went back into the cottage to make ready for her journeying,
    throwing her red riding-cloak over her shoulders, and drawing
    her thick shoes upon her feet. Then she filled her reticule
    with a parcel of simples, in case they should be needed. After
    this she came out again, and climbed up behind the little man
    in green, and so settled herself upon the pillion saddle for
    her ride. Then the little man whistled to his horse, and away
    they went.</p>

    <p>They seemed to fly rather than ride upon the hard ground,
    for the hedges and cottages and orchards flew past as though in
    a dream. But fast as they went, the <!-- Page 57 --><a name=
    "Page_57"
       id="Page_57"></a>old dame saw many things which she had
       never dreamed of before. She saw all of the hedge-rows, the
       by-ways, the woods and fields alive with fairy-folk. Each
       little body was busy upon his or her own business, laughing,
       chatting, talking, and running here and there like folks on
       a market-day.</p><br>


    <div class="ctr">

        <p class="caption">"DAME TWIST VISITS A STRANGE
        PATIENT"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>So they came at last to a place which the dame knew was the
    three-tree-hill; but it was not the three-tree-hill which she
    had seen in all of her life before, for a great
    <!-- Page 58 --><a name="Page_58"
       id="Page_58"></a>gateway seemed to open into it and it was
       into this gateway that the little man in green urged the
       great white horse.</p>

    <p>After they had entered the hill, Dame Margery climbed down
    from the pillion and stood looking about her. Then she saw that
    she was in a great hall, the walls of which were glistening
    with gold and silver, while bright stones gleamed like so many
    stars all over the roof of the place. Three little fairy
    children were playing with golden balls on the floor, and when
    they saw the dame they stopped in their sport and stood looking
    silently upon her with great, wide-opened eyes, just as though
    they were little mortal children. In the corner of the room was
    a bed all of pure gold, and over the bed were spread coverlets
    of gold and silver cloth, and in the bed lay a beautiful little
    lady, very white and ill. Then Dame Margery knew well enough
    that every one of these little people were fairies.</p>

    <p>The dame nursed the fairy lady all that night, and by
    cock-crow in the morning the little woman had ease from her
    pain.</p>

    <p>Then the little man spoke for the first time since Dame
    Margery had left home. "Look'ee, Dame Margery," said he; "I
    promised to pay you well and I will keep my word. Come hither!"
    So the dame went to him as he had bidden her to do, and the
    little man filled her reticule with black coals from the
    hearth. The dame said nothing, but she wondered much whether
    the little man called this good pay for her pains. After this
    she climbed up on the great horse again, and behind the little
    man, and they rode out of the place and
       <!-- Page 59 --><a name="Page_59"
       id="Page_59"></a><!-- Page 62 --><a name="Page_62"
       id="Page_62"></a>home, where they were safe and sound ere
       the day had fairly broken. But before the little man had
       left her he drew out another little box just like the one
       that Tommy Lamb had brought her the evening before, only
       this time the box was filled with red ointment. "Rub your
       eyes with this, Dame Margery," said he.</p><br>


    <div class="ctr">
        <a id="LITTLE_FOLKS"></a> <a href=

        <p class="caption">"DAME TWIST DRIVES AWAY THE LITTLE
        FOLKS"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>Now Dame Margery Twist knew butter from cheese, as the
    saying is. She knew that the green salve was of a kind which
    very few people have had rubbed over their eyes in this world;
    that it was of a kind which poets would give their ears to
    possess&mdash;even were it a lump no larger than a pea. So,
    when she took the box of red ointment, she only rubbed one eye
    with it&mdash;her left eye. Her right eye she pretended to rub,
    but, in truth, she never touched it at all.</p>

    <p>Then the little man got upon his horse again, and rode away
    to his home in the hill.</p>

    <p>After he had gone away, Dame Margery thought that she would
    empty her reticule of the dirty black coals; so she turned it
    topsy-turvy, and shook it over the hearth, and out
    tumbled&mdash;black coals? No; great lumps of pure gold that
    shone bright yellow, like fire, in the light of the candle. The
    good dame could scarcely believe her eyes, for here was wealth
    enough to keep her in comfort for all the rest of her days.</p>

    <p>But Dame Margery's right eye! I wish I could only see what
    she saw with that right eye of hers! What was it she saw? That
    I will tell you.</p>

    <p>The next night was full moon, and Dame Margery came and
    looked out over the fine bed of tulips, of which she was very
    proud. "Hey-day!" she cried, and rubbed
       <!-- Page 63 --><a name="Page_63"
       id="Page_63"></a>her eyes, in doubt as to whether she was
       asleep or awake, for the whole place was alive with little
       folks.</p>

    <p>But she was awake, and it was certain that she saw them.
    Yes; there they were&mdash;little men, little women, little
    children, and little babies, as thick in the tulip bed as folks
    at a wedding. The little men sat smoking their pipes and
    talking together; the little women sat nursing their babies,
    singing to them or rocking them to sleep in cradles of tulip
    flowers; the little children played at hide-and-seek among the
    flower-stalks. So the dame leaned out of the window, watching
    them with great delight, for it is always a delight to watch
    the little folks at their sports.</p><br>


    <div class="ctr">
        <a id="Fair"></a> <a href=

        <p class="caption">"Dame Margery Twist goeth to see the
        merry doings at the Fair."</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>After a while she saw where one of the tiny fairy children
    hid himself under a leaf, while the others who were to seek him
    looked up and down, and high and low, but could find him
    nowhere. Then the old dame laughed and laughed to see how the
    others looked for the little fellow, but could not tell where
    he was. At last she could hold her peace no longer, but called
    out in a loud voice, "Look under the leaf, Blackcap!"</p>

    <p><!-- Page 64 --><a name="Page_64"
       id="Page_64"></a>The words were no sooner out of her mouth
       than, whisk! whirr! off they scampered out of the garden and
       away&mdash;fathers, mothers, children, babies, all crying in
       their shrill voices, "She sees us! she sees us!" For fairies
       are very timid folk, and dread nothing more than to have
       mortals see them in their own shapes.</p>

    <p>So they never came back again to the dame's garden, and from
    that day to this her tulips have been like everybody else's
    tulips. Moreover, whenever she went out the fairies scampered
    away before her like so many mice, for they all knew that she
    could see them with her magical eye. This, as you may see, was
    bad enough, but no other harm would have come of it if she had
    only gathered wisdom at that time, seeing what ill came of her
    speech. But, like many other old dames that I wot of, no sound
    was so pleasant to her ears as the words of her own mouth.</p>

    <p>Now, about a twelvemonth after the time that the dame had
    nursed the fairy lady, the great fair was held at Tavistock.
    All the world and his wife were there, so, of course, Dame
    Margery went also. And the fair was well worth going to, I can
    tell you! Booths stood along in a row in the yellow sunlight of
    the summer-time, and flags and streamers of many colors
    fluttered in the breeze from long poles at the end of each
    booth. Ale flowed like water, and dancing was going on on the
    green, for Peter Weeks the piper was there, and his pipes were
    with him. It was a fine sight to see all of the youths and
    maids, decked in fine ribbons of pink and blue, dancing
    hand-in-hand to his piping. In the great tent the country
    people had spread out their goods&mdash;butter,
    <!-- Page 65 --><a name="Page_65"
       id="Page_65"></a>cheese, eggs, honey, and the
       like&mdash;making as goodly a show as you would want to see.
       Dame Margery was in her glory, for she had people to gossip
       with everywhere; so she went hither and thither, and at last
       into the great tent where these things of which I have
       spoken were all spread out for show.</p><br>

    <p>Then, lo and behold! who should she see, gliding here and
    there among the crowd of other people, but the little man in
    green whom she had seen a year ago. She opened her eyes
    mightily wide, for she saw that he was doing a strange thing.
    By his side hung a little earthen<!-- Page 66 --><a name=
    "Page_66"
       id="Page_66"></a>ware pot, and in his hand he held a little
       wooden scraper, which he passed over the rolls of butter,
       afterwards putting that which he scraped from the rolls into
       the pot that hung beside him. Dame Margery peeped into the
       pot, and saw that it was half full; then she could contain
       herself no longer.</p>

    <p>"Hey-day, neighbor!" cried she, "here be pretty doings,
    truly! Out upon thee, to go scraping good luck and full measure
    off of other folks' butter!"</p>

    <p>When the little man in green heard the dame speak to him, he
    was so amazed that he nearly dropped his wooden scraper. "Why,
    Dame Margery! can you see me then?"</p>

    <p>"Aye, marry can I! And what you are about doing also; out
    upon you, say I!"</p>

    <p>"And did you not rub your eyes with the red salve then?"
    said the little man.</p>

    <p>"One eye, yes, but one eye, no," said the dame, slyly.</p>

    <p>"Which eye do you see me with?" said he.</p>

    <p>"With this eye, gossip, and very clearly, I would have you
    know," and she pointed to her right eye.</p>

    <p>Then the little man swelled out his cheeks until they were
    like two little brown dumplings. Puff! he blew a breath into
    the good dame's eye. Puff! he blew, and if the dame's eye had
    been a candle, the light of it could not have gone out
    sooner.</p>

    <p>The dame felt no smart, but she might wink and wink, and
    wink again, but she would never wink sight into the eye upon
    which the little man had blown his breath, for it was blind as
    the stone wall back of the mill, where Tom the tinker kissed
    the miller's daughter.</p>

    <p><!-- Page 67 --><a name="Page_67"
       id="Page_67"></a>Dame Margery Twist never greatly missed the
       sight of that eye; but all the same, I would give both of
       mine for it.</p>

    <p>All of these things are told at Tavistock town even to this
    day; and if you go thither, you may hear them for yourself.</p>

    <p>But I say again, as I said at first: if one could<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">only hold one's tongue as to
    what one sees,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">one would be the better for
    it.</span></p>

    <h2>A VICTIM TO SCIENCE</h2>

    <p>Th're were two wise physicians once, of glory and
    renown,<br>
     Who went to take a little walk nigh famous Concord town.<br>
     Oh! very, very great and wise and learned men were they,<br>
     And wise and learned was th'r talk, as they walked on th'r
    way.<br>
     And as they walked and talked and talked, they came to wh're
    they found<br>
     A Crow as black as any hat, a-sitting on ye ground.<br>
     Ye Crow was very, very sick, as you may quickly see<br>
     By just looking at ye picture th't is drawn h're by me.<br>
     Now wh'n ye doctors came to him they mended of th'r pace,<br>
     And said one unto ye other, "H're's an interesting case,<br>
     A case th't sh'ld be treated, and be treated speedily.<br>
     I have&mdash;yes, here it is&mdash;a pill th't has been made
    by me.<br>
     Now, I have had occasion&mdash;" Said ye other, "In most
    cases<br>
     Your pills are excellently good, but h're, my friend, are
    traces<br>
     Of a lassitude, a languor, th't your pills c'ld hardly
    aid;<br>
     In short, they're rather violent for th's, I am afraid.<br>
     <i>I</i> have a tincture&mdash;" Said ye first, "Your tincture
    cannot touch<br>
     A case as difficult as th's, my pills are better much."<br>
     "Your pills, sir, are too violent." "Your tonic is too
    weak."<br>
     "As I have said, sir, in th's case&mdash;" "Permit me, sir, to
    speak."<br>
     And so they argued long and high, and on, and on, and on,<br>
     Until they lost their tempers, and an hour or more had
    gone.<br>
     But long before their arguments ye question did decide,<br>
     Ye Crow, not waiting for ye end, incontinently died.<br>

    <h2>PLAY &amp; EARNEST</h2>

    <p>Over dewy hill and lea<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Merrily</span><br>
     Rushed a mad-cap breeze at play,<br>
     And the daisies, like the bright<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Stars at night,</span><br>
     Danced and twinkled in its way.<br>
    <br>
     Now, a tree called to the breeze,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Little breeze,</span><br>
     Will you come and have a play?"<br>
     And the wind upon its way<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Stopped to play.</span><br>
     Then the leaves, with sudden shiver,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sudden quiver,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Met the light</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mad-cap breeze</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">With delight.</span><br>
    <br>
     Presently the breeze grew stronger,<br>
     For it cared to play no longer.<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">So it flung the limbs
    about,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And it tossed the leaves in
    rout,</span><br>
     Till it roared, as though with thunder.<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then the poor tree groaned and
    bent,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the breeze,&mdash;a
    tempest,&mdash;rent</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Leaves and branches from its
    crowns</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till, at last, it flung it
    down,</span><br>
     Stripped, and bare, and torn asunder.<br>

    <h2>THE ACCIDENT OF BIRTH.</h2><span style=
    "margin-left: 1em;"><i>Saint Nicholas</i> used to send, so I am
    told,</span> <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">All new-born babes by storks,
    in days of old.</span> <br>
     <br>


    <p>1<br>
     King Friedrich Max of Stultzenmannenkim,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">For many years unto the Saint
    did pray,</span><br>
     That he would send unto his Queen and him,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">A baby boy, to be the King
    some day.</span><br>
     At last the Saint the King's petition heard,<br>
     And called to him a sober long-legged bird.<br>
    <br>
     2<br>
     Quoth he, "Good Wilhelm Stork (such was its name),<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Here is a baby boy to take
    away.</span><br>
     It is for Fritz; so bear him to the same,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or rather to his Queen,
    without delay.</span><br>
     For one grows weary when one always hears<br>
     The same words daily dinning in one's ears."<br>
    <br>
     3<br>
     Now Wilhelm Stork was old, and dull of wits,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">For age not always sharpens
    wisdom much,</span><br>
     So what does he but bear the gift to Fritz<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">The cobbler, who had half a
    score of such.</span><br>
     And so the baby, through a blunder, passed<br>
     From being first of all, unto&mdash;<i>ye last</i>.<br>
    <br>
     4<br>
     From this I gather that a new-born Prince,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">From new-born cobbler's
    somewhat hard to know,</span><br>
     For which of us could tell the difference, since<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">One thus experienced was
    mistaken so?</span><br>
     Also, perhaps, <i>I</i> should be great, instead<br>
     Of writing thus, to earn my daily bread.<br>

    <p>"Yes, Peter is clever." So said his mother; but then every
    goose thinks her own gosling a swan.</p>

    <p>The minister and all of the people of the village said Peter
    was but a dull block. Maybe Peter <i>was</i> a fool; but, as
    the old saying goes, never a fool tumbles out of the tree but
    he lights on his toes. So now you shall hear how that Peter
    sold his two baskets of eggs for more than you or I could do,
    wise as we be.</p>

    <p>"Peter," said his mother.</p>

    <p>"Yes," said Peter, for he was well brought up, and always
    answered when he was spoken to.</p>

    <p>"My dear little child, thou art wise, though so young now;
    how shall we get money to pay our rent?"</p>

    <p>"Sell the eggs that the speckled hen has laid," said
    Peter.</p>

    <p>"But when we have spent the money for them, what then?"</p>

    <p>"Sell more eggs," said Peter, for he had an answer for
    everything.</p>

    <p>"But when the speckled hen lays no more eggs, what shall we
    do then?"</p>

    <p>"We shall see," said Peter.</p>

    <p>"<!-- Page 69 --><a name="Page_69"
       id="Page_69"></a>Now indeed art thou wise," said his mother,
       "and I take thy meaning; it is this, when we have spent all,
       we must do as the little birds do, and trust in the good
       Heaven." Peter meant nothing of the kind, but then folks
       will think that such wise fellows as Peter and I mean more
       than we say, whence comes our wisdom.</p>

    <p>So the next day Peter started off to the town, with the
    basket full of nice white eggs. The day was bright and warm and
    fair; the wind blew softly, and the wheatfields lay like green
    velvet in the sun. The flowers were sprinkled all over the
    grass, and the bees kicked up their yellow legs as they tilted
    into them. The garlic stuck up stout spikes into the air, and
    the young radishes were green and lusty. The brown bird in the
    tree sang, "Cuckoo! cuckoo!" and Peter trudged contentedly
    along, kicking up little clouds of dust at every footstep,
    whistling merrily and staring up into the bright sky, where the
    white clouds hung like little sheep, feeding on the wide blue
    field. "If those clouds were sheep, and the sheep were mine,
    then I would be a great man and very proud," said Peter. But
    the clouds were clouds, and he was not a great man;
    nevertheless, he whistled more merrily than ever, for it was
    very nice to think of these things.</p>

    <p>So he trudged along with great comfort until high noontide,
    against which time he had come nigh to the town, for he could
    see the red roofs and the tall spires peeping over the crest of
    the next green hill. By this time his stomach was crying,
    "Give! give!" for it longed for bread and cheese. Now, a great
    gray stone stood near by at the forking of the road, and just
    as Peter came <!-- Page 72 --><a name="Page_72"
       id="Page_72"></a>to it he heard a noise. "Click! clack!" he
       turned his head, and, lo and behold! the side of the stone
       opened like a door, and out came a little old man dressed
       all in fine black velvet. "Good-day, Peter," said he.
       "Good-day, sir," said Peter, and he took off his hat as he
       spoke, for he could see with half an eye that this little
       old gentleman was none of your cheese-paring fine folks.</p>

    <p>"Will you strike a bargain with me for your eggs?" said the
    little old man. Yes, Peter would strike a bargain; what would
    the little gentleman give him for his eggs? "I will give you
    this," said the little old man, and he drew a black bottle out
    of his pocket.</p>

    <p>Peter took the bottle and turned it over and over in his
    hands. "It is," said he, "a pretty little, good little, sweet
    little bottle, but it is not worth as much as my basket of
    eggs."</p>

    <p>"Prut!" said the little gentleman, "now you are not talking
    like the wise Peter. You should never judge by the outside of
    things. What would you like to have?"</p>

    <p>"I should like," said Peter, "to have a good dinner."</p>

    <p>"Nothing easier!" said the little gentleman, and he drew the
    cork. Pop! pop! and what should come out of the bottle but two
    tall men, dressed all in blue with gold trimmings. "What will
    you have, sir?" said the first of these to the little
    gentleman.</p>

    <p>"A good dinner for two," said the little man.</p>

    <p>No sooner said than done; for, before you could say Frederic
    Strutzenwillenbachen, there stood a table, with a sweet, clean,
    white cloth spread over it, and on this was the nicest dinner
    that you ever saw, for there were beer and chitterlings, and
    cheese and good white <!-- Page 73 --><a name="Page_73"
       id="Page_73"></a>bread, fit for the king. Then Peter and the
       little man fell to with might and main, and ate till they
       could eat no more. After they were done, the two tall men
       took table and dishes and all back into the bottle again,
       and the little gentleman corked it up.</p><br>

    <p>"Yes," said Peter, "I will give you my basket of eggs
    <!-- Page 74 --><a name="Page_74"
       id="Page_74"></a>for the little black bottle." And so the
       bargain was struck. Then Peter started off home, and the
       little man went back again into the great stone and closed
       the door behind him. He took the basket of eggs with him;
       where he took it neither Peter nor I will ever be able to
       tell you.</p>

    <p>So Peter trudged along homeward, until, after a while, the
    day waxing warm, he grew tired. "I wish," said he, "that I had
    a fine white horse to ride."</p>

    <p>Then he took the cork out of the bottle. Pop! pop! and out
    came the two tall fellows, just as they had done for the little
    old man. "What will you have, sir?" said the first of them.</p>

    <p>"I will have," said Peter, "a fine white horse to ride."</p>

    <p>No sooner said than done; for there, before him in the road,
    stood a fine white horse, with a long mane and tail, just like
    so much spun silk. In his mouth was a silver bit; on his back
    was a splendid saddle, covered all over with gold and jewels;
    on his feet were shoes of pure gold, so that he was a very
    handsome horse indeed.</p>

    <p>Peter mounted on his great horse and rode away home, as
    grand as though he were a lord or a nobleman.</p>

    <p>Every one whom he met stopped in the middle of the road and
    looked after him. "Just look at Peter!" cried they; but Peter
    held his chin very high, and rode along without looking at
    them, for he knew what a fine sight he was on his white
    horse.</p>

    <p>And so he came home again.</p>

    <p>"What didst thou get for thy eggs, my little duck?" said his
    mother.</p>

    <p>"I got a bottle, mother," said Peter.</p>

    <p><!-- Page 75 --><a name="Page_75"
       id="Page_75"></a>Then at first Peter's mother began to think
       as others thought, that Peter was a dull block. But when she
       saw what a wonderful bottle it was, and how it held many
       good things and one over, she changed her mind again, and
       thought that her Peter was as wise as the moon.</p>

    <p>And now nothing was lacking in the cottage; if Peter and his
    mother wanted this, it came to them; if they wished for that,
    the two tall men in the bottle fetched it. They lined the house
    all inside with pure gold, and built the chimneys of bricks of
    silver, so that there was nothing so fine between all the four
    great rivers. Peter dressed in satin and his mother in silk,
    and everybody called him "Lord Peter." Even the minister of the
    village said that he was no dull boy, for nobody is dull who
    rides on horseback and never wears wooden shoes. So now Peter
    was a rich man.</p><br>

    <p>One morning Peter said to his mother, "Mother, I am going to
    ask the King to let me marry his daughter."</p>

    <p>To this his mother said nothing, for surely her Peter was as
    good as any princess that ever lived.</p>

    <p>So off Peter rode, dressed all in his best and seated
    astride of a grand horse. At last he came to the palace
    <!-- Page 78 --><a name="Page_78"
       id="Page_78"></a>which was finer than the handsome new house
       of Herr Mayor Kopff. Rap! rap! rap! Peter knocked at the
       door, and presently came a neat servant girl and opened it
       to him. "Is the King at home, my dear?" said Peter.</p>

    <p>Yes, the King was at home; would he come into the parlor and
    sit down? So Peter went into the parlor and sat down, and then
    the King came in, dressed all in his best dressing-gown, with
    silver slippers upon his feet, and a golden crown upon his
    head.</p>

    <p>"What is your name?" said the King.</p>

    <p>"Peter Stultzenmilchen," said Peter.</p>

    <p>"And what do you want, Lord Peter," said the King; for, as I
    have said, Peter was dressed in his best clothes, and the old
    King thought that he was a great lord.</p>

    <p>"I want to marry your daughter," said Peter.</p>

    <p>To this the King said "Hum-m-m," and Peter said nothing.
    Then the King said that he had determined that no one should
    marry his daughter without bringing him a basketful of
    diamonds, rubies, topazes, emeralds, pearls, and all manner of
    precious stones; for he thought by this to get rid of
    Peter.</p>

    <p>"Is that all?" said Peter. "Nothing is easier."</p>

    <p>So off he went, until he came to a chestnut woods just back
    of the royal kitchen-garden. There he uncorked his bottle. Pop!
    pop! and out came the two tall men. "What will you have, sir?"
    said they. Peter told them what he wanted, and it was no sooner
    said than done; for, there on the ground before him, stood a
    basketful of all kinds of precious stones; each of them was as
    large as a hen's egg, and over all of them was
    <!-- Page 79 --><a name="Page_79"
       id="Page_79"></a>spread a nice clean white napkin. So Peter
       took the basket on his arm and went back again to the
       palace.</p>

    <p>But how the King did open his eyes, to be sure, and how he
    stared! "Now," said Peter, "I should like to marry your
    daughter, if you please."</p>

    <p>At this the King hemmed and hawed again. No, Peter could not
    marry the Princess yet, for the King had determined that no man
    should marry his daughter without bringing him a bird all of
    pure silver that could sing whenever it was wanted, and that
    more sweetly than a nightingale; for he thought that now he
    should be rid of Peter, at any rate.</p>

    <p>"Nothing easier," said Peter, and off he went again.</p>

    <p>When he had come to the chestnut woods, he uncorked his
    bottle and told the two tall men what he wanted. No sooner said
    than done; for there was a bird all of pure silver. And not
    only that, but the bird sat in a little golden tree, and the
    leaves of the tree were emeralds, and rubies hung like cherries
    from the branches.</p>

    <p>Then Peter wrapped this up in his handkerchief and took it
    to the palace. As for the King, he could not look at it or
    listen to it enough.</p>

    <p>"Now," said Peter, "I should like to marry your daughter, if
    you please."</p>

    <p>But at this the King sang the same tune again. No, Peter
    could not marry his daughter yet, for the King had determined
    that the man who was to marry his daughter should first bring
    him a golden sword, so keen that it could cut a feather
    floating in the air, yet so strong that it could cut through an
    iron bar.</p>

    <p>"Nothing easier," said Peter, and this time the men
    <!-- Page 80 --><a name="Page_80"
       id="Page_80"></a>of the bottle brought him such a sword as
       he asked for, and the hilt was studded all over with
       precious stones, so that it was very handsome indeed. Then
       Peter brought it to the King, and it did as the King would
       have it&mdash;it cut through a feather floating in the air;
       as for the iron bar, it cut through that as easily as you
       would bite through a radish.</p><br>


    <div class="ctr">

        <p class="caption">"Peter Eats With the King and
        Princess"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>And now it seemed as though there was nothing else to be
    done but to let Peter marry the Princess. So the King asked him
    in to supper, and they all three sat down together, the King
    and the Princess and Peter. And <!-- Page 81 --><a name=
    "Page_81"
       id="Page_81"></a>it was a fine feast, I can tell you, for
       they had both white and red wine, besides sausages and
       cheese, and real white bread and puddings, and all manner of
       good things; for kings and princesses eat and drink of the
       best.</p>

    <p>As for Peter, he made eyes at the Princess, and the Princess
    looked down on her plate and blushed, and Peter thought that he
    had never seen such a pretty girl.</p>

    <p>After a while the King began to question Peter how he came
    by all these fine things&mdash;the precious stones, the silver
    bird, and the golden sword; but no, Peter would not tell. Then
    the King and the Princess begged and begged him, until, at
    last, Peter lost his wits and told all about the bottle. Then
    the King said nothing more, and presently, it being nine
    o'clock, Peter went to bed. After he had gone the King and the
    Princess put their heads together, and the end of the matter
    was that the wicked King went to Peter's room and stole the
    bottle from under the pillow where he had hidden it, and put
    one in its place that was as empty as a beer barrel after the
    soldiers have been in the town; for the King and the Princess
    thought that it would be a fine thing to have the bottle for
    themselves.</p>

    <p>When the next morning had come, and they were all sitting at
    their breakfast together, the King said, "Now, Lord Peter, let
    us see what your bottle will do; give us such and such a kind
    of wine."</p>

    <p>"Nothing easier," said Peter. Then he uncorked the bottle,
    but not so much as a single dead fly came out of it.</p>

    <p>"But where is the wine?" said the King.</p>

    <p>"I do not know," said Peter.</p>

    <p><!-- Page 82 --><a name="Page_82"
       id="Page_82"></a>At this the King called him hard names and
       turned him out of the palace, neck and heels; so back poor
       Peter went to his mother with a flea in his ear, as the
       saying is. Now he was poor again, and everybody called him a
       dull block, for he rode no great white horse and he wore
       wooden shoes.</p>

    <p>"Never mind," said his mother, "here is another basket of
    eggs from the speckled hen." So Peter set off with these to the
    market town, as he had done with the others before. When he had
    come to the great stone at the forking of the road, whom should
    he meet but the same little gentleman he had met the first
    time. "Will you strike a bargain?" said he. Yes, Peter would
    strike a bargain, and gladly. Thereupon the little old man
    brought out another black bottle.</p>

    <p>"Two men are in this bottle," said the little old man; "when
    they have done all that you want them to do, say 'brikket-ligg'
    and they will go back again. Will you trade with me?" Yes,
    Peter would trade. So Peter gave the little man the eggs, and
    the little man gave Peter the second bottle, and they parted
    very good friends.</p>

    <p>After a while Peter grew tired. "Now," said he to himself,
    "I will ride a little"; and so he drew the cork out of the
    bottle. Pop! pop! out came two men from the bottle; but this
    time they were ugly and black, and each held a stout stick in
    his hand. They said not a word, but, without more ado, fell
    upon Peter and began threshing him as though he was wheat on
    the barn floor. "Stop! stop!" cried Peter, and he went hopping
    and skipping up and down, and here and there, but it seemed as
    though the two ugly black men did not hear him, for
    <!-- Page 83 --><a name="Page_83"
       id="Page_83"></a>the blows fell as thick as hail on the
       roof. At last he gathered his wits together, like a flock of
       pigeons, and cried, "Brikket-ligg! brikket-ligg!" Then,
       whisk! pop! they went back into the bottle again, and Peter
       corked it up, and corked it tightly, I can tell you.</p><br>

        <p class="caption">"Clever Peter and the Unlucky

    </div><br>


    <p>The next day he started off to the palace once more.
    <!-- Page 84 --><a name="Page_84"
       id="Page_84"></a>Rap! rap! rap! he knocked at the door. Was
       the King at home? Yes, the King was at home; would he come
       and sit in the parlor?</p>

    <p>Presently the King came in, in dressing-gown and slippers.
    "What! are you back again?" said he.</p>

    <p>"Yes; I am back again," said Peter.</p>

    <p>"What do you want?" said the King.</p>

    <p>"I want to marry the Princess," said Peter.</p>

    <p>"What have you brought this time?" said the King.</p>

    <p>"I have brought another bottle," said Peter.</p>

    <p>Then the King rubbed his hands and was very polite indeed,
    and asked Peter in to breakfast, and Peter went. So they all
    three sat down together, the King, the Princess, and Peter.</p>

    <p>"My dear," said the King, to the Princess, "the Lord Peter
    has brought another bottle with him." Thereat the Princess was
    very polite also. Would Lord Peter let them see the bottle? Oh
    yes! Peter would do that: so he drew it out of his pocket and
    sat it upon the table.</p>

    <p>Perhaps they would like to have it opened. Yes, that they
    would. So Peter opened the bottle.</p>

    <p>Hui! what a hubbub there was! The King hopped about till his
    slippers flew off, his dressing-gown fluttered like great
    wings, and his crown rolled off from his head and across the
    floor, like a quoit at the fair. As for the Princess, she never
    danced in all of her life as she danced that morning. They made
    such a noise that the soldiers of the Royal Guard came running
    in; but the two tall black men spared them no more than the
    King and the Princess. Then came all of the Lords of the
    Council, and they likewise danced to the same music as the
    rest.</p>

    <p>"<!-- Page 85 --><a name="Page_85"
       id="Page_85"></a>Oh, Peter! dear Lord Peter! cork up your
       men again!" they all cried.</p>

    <p>"Will you give me back my bottle?" said Peter.</p>

    <p>"Yes! yes!" cried the King.</p>

    <p>"Will you marry me?" said Peter.</p>

    <p>"Yes! yes!" cried the Princess.</p>

    <p>Then Peter said "brikket-ligg!" and the two tall men popped
    back into the bottle again. So the King gave him back his other
    bottle, and the minister was called in and married him to the
    Princess.</p>

    <p>After that he lived happily, and when the old King died he
    became King over all of the land. As for the Princess, she was
    as good a wife as you ever saw, but Peter always kept the
    bottle near to him&mdash;maybe that was the reason.</p>

    <p class="center">Ah me! if I could only take my eggs to such
    a<br>
     market and get two such bottles for them!<br>
     What would I do with them? It would<br>
     take too long to tell you.</p>

    <h2>YE ROMANTIC ADVENTURES OF THREE TAILORS</h2>

    <p>Three little men went ajogging along&mdash;<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Along in the sunshiny
    weather.</span><br>
     And they laughed and they sang an occasional song<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which they all of them caroled
    together.</span><br>
     And the great white clouds floated over the sky<br>
     And the day it was warm and the sun it was high.<br>
    <br>
     As three jolly tailor men all were they<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">As you'd find in a dozen of
    years.</span><br>
     One carried the yardstick another the goose<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the bravest of all bore
    the shears</span><br>
     So they merrily trudged until after awhile<br>
     The came where three milk-maids sat all on a stile.<br>
    <br>
     The grass it was green and the flowers were gay,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And it was the pleasantest
    weather.</span><br>
     And the milkmaids were pretty as blossoms in May<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">As they sat on the stile all
    together.</span><br>
     Then they stopped on the high-way those three gallant men<br>
     For they never had seen as fair lasses as then.<br>
    <br>
     Then up spake the first of the tailor men three<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the one with the goodliest
    parts.</span><br>
     "We are all of us good men gallant and free<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And have never yet plighted
    our hearts.</span><br>
     So prithee fair maids will you marry us all<br>
     For our hearts they be great as our bodies be small."<br>
    <br>
     Then up spake the first of the three pretty dears<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Pray tell what your fortunes
    may be sir."</span><br>
     "Oh three loving hearts and a yard goose and shears."<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Then you've not enough
    fortune for me sir.</span><br>
     So get you along while your boots are still green<br>
     For richer young men we shall marry I ween."<br>
    <br>
     Three little tailor men jogging along&mdash;<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Along in the sunshiny
    weather.</span><br>
     No longer they laugh with a jest and a song<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">But they walk very sadly
    together.</span><br>
     For when maidens are proud like the milkmaidens cold,<br>
     The lads they grow sad like the tailors so bold.<br>

    <h2>FANCY AND FACT</h2>

    <p>O! a shepherd and a shepherdess,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">They dwelt in
    Arcadee,</span><br>
     And they were dressed in Watteau dress,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Most charming for to
    see.</span><br>
    <br>
     They sat upon the dewy grass,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">With buds and blossoms
    set.</span><br>
     And the shepherd played unto the lass,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon a flageolet.</span><br>
    <br>
     It seemed to me as though it was<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">A very pleasant
    thing;</span><br>
     Particularly so because<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The time of year was
    Spring.</span><br>
    <br>
     But, O! the ground was damp, and so,<br>

    <h2>YE TWO WISHES</h2>

    <p>An Angel went a walking out one day, as I've heard said,<br>
     And, coming to a faggot-maker, begged a crust of bread<br>
     The faggot-maker gave a crust and something rather queer<br>
     To wash it down withall, from out a bottle that stood
    near.<br>
     The Angel finished eating; but before he left, said he,<br>
     "Thou shalt have two wishes granted, for that thou hast given
    me.<br>
     One wish for that good drinkable, another for the bread."<br>
     The he left the faggot-maker all amazed at what he'd said.<br>
    <br>
     "I wonder," says the faggot-maker, after he had gone,<br>
     "I wonder if there's any truth in that same little song!"<br>
     So, turning this thing over in his mind, he cast around,<br>
     'Till he saw the empty bottle where it lay upon the
    ground.<br>
     "I wish," said he, just as a test, "if what he said is so,<br>
     Into that empty bottle, now, that I may straightway go"<br>
     No sooner said that done; for,&mdash;<i>Whisk!</i> into the
    flask he fell,<br>
     Where he found himself as tightly packed as chicken in the
    shell.<br>
     In vain he kicked and twisted, and in vain he howled with
    pain;<br>
     For, in spite of all his efforts, he could not get out
    again.<br>
     So, seeing how the matter stood, he had to wish once more.<br>
     When, out he slipped, as easily as he'd gone in before.<br>
    <br>
     If we had two wishes, granted by an Angel thus,<br>
     We would not throw away the good so kindly given us.<br>
     For first we'd ask for wisdom, which, when we had in
    store,<br>
     I'm very doubtful if we'd care to ask for anymore.<br>

    <h2>A VERSE WITH A MORAL BUT NO NAME</h2>

    <p>A wise man once, of Haarlem town,<br>
     Went wandering up, and wandering down,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ever the question
    asked:</span><br>
    <br>
     "If all the world was paper,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And if all the sea was
    ink,</span><br>
     And if the trees were bread and cheese,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">What would we do for
    drink?"</span><br>
    <br>
     Then all the folk, both great and small,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Began to beat their
    brains,</span><br>
     But they could not answer him at all,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">In spite of all their
    pains.</span><br>
    <br>
     But still he wandered here and there,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">This man of great
    renown,</span><br>
     And still he questioned everywhere,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The folk of Haarlem
    town:</span><br>
    <br>
     "If all the world was paper,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And if all the sea was
    ink,</span><br>
     And if the trees were bread and cheese,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">What would we do for
    drink?"</span><br>
    <br>
     Full thin he grew, as, day by day,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">He toiled with mental
    strain,</span><br>
     Until the wind blew him away,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he ne'er was seen
    again.</span><br>
    <br>
     And now methinks I hear you say,<br>
     "Was ere a man so foolish, pray,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since first the world
    began?"</span><br>
     Oh, hush! I'll tell you secretly<br>
     Down East there dwells a man, and he<br>
     Is asking questions constantly,<br>
     That none can answer, that I see,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet he's a wise-wise

             alt="HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK"
             title="HANS HECKLEMANN'S LUCK">
    </div>

    <p>Hans Hecklemann had no luck at all. Now and then we hear
    folks say that they have no luck, but they only mean that their
    luck is bad and that they are ashamed of it. Everybody but Hans
    Hecklemann had luck of some kind, either good or bad, and, what
    is more, everybody carries his luck about with him; some carry
    it in their pocket-books, some carry it in their hats, some
    carry it on their finger tips, and some carry it under their
    tongues&mdash;these are lawyers. Mine is at this moment sitting
    astride of my pen, though I can no more see it than though it
    was thin air; whether it is good or bad depends entirely as to
    how <i>you</i> look upon it.</p>

    <p>But Hans Hecklemann had no luck at all. How he lost it
    nobody knows, but it is certain that it was clean gone from
    him.</p>

    <p>He was as poor as charity, and yet his luck was not bad,
    for, poor as he was, he always had enough for his wife and his
    family and himself to eat. They all of them worked from dawn to
    nightfall, and yet his luck was not good, for he never laid one
    penny on top of the other, as the saying is. He had food enough
    to eat, and clothes enough to wear, so his luck was not
    indifferent. <!-- Page 87 --><a name="Page_87"
       id="Page_87"></a>Now, as it was neither good, bad, nor
       indifferent, you see that it could have been no luck at
       all.</p>

    <p>Hans Hecklemann's wife was named Catherine. One evening when
    Hans came into the cottage with just enough money to buy them
    all bread and not a cracked farthing to spare, Catherine spoke
    to him of this matter.</p>

    <p>"Hans," said she, "you have no luck at all."</p><br>


    <div class="ctr">
        <a id="Hans_Hecklemann_Catherine"></a> <a href=
        "images/hanscatherinefull.png"><img src=

             alt="Hans Hecklemann, Catherine."
             title="Hans Hecklemann, Catherine."></a>

        <p class="caption">"Hans Hecklemann, Catherine."</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>"No," said Hans, "I have not," which was the truth, as I
    have already told you.</p>

    <p>"What are you going to do about it?" said Catherine.</p>

    <p>"Nothing at all," said Hans.</p>

    <p>"Doing nothing puts no cabbage into the pot," said
    Catherine.</p>

    <p>"It takes none out," said Hans.</p>

    <p>"<!-- Page 88 --><a name="Page_88"
       id="Page_88"></a>See, Hans," said Catherine; "go to the old
       wise woman in the wood and talk to her about it; who knows
       but that she can tell you how and where you lost your
       luck?"</p>

    <p>"If I should find my luck it might be bad and not good,"
    said Hans.</p>

    <p>"It is worth having a look at," said Catherine; "you can
    leave it where you find it if it does not please you."</p>

    <p>"No," said Hans; "when a man finds his luck he has to take
    it, whether he likes it or no."</p>

    <p>So Hans talked, but he had made up his mind to do as
    Catherine said, to go and see the old wise woman in the wood.
    He argued with her, but he only argued with her to let her know
    how little was her knowledge and how great was his. After he
    had clearly shown her how poor her advice was, he took it. Many
    other men are like Hans Hecklemann.</p>

    <p>So, early the next morning, Hans jogged along to the old
    wise woman's cottage, while the day was sweet and fresh. The
    hedgerows were covered all over with white blossoms, as though
    it was with so much snow; the cuckoo was singing among the
    budding branches, and the little flowers were looking up
    everywhere with their bright faces. "Surely," said Hans to
    himself, "if I find my luck on this day, it must be good and
    not ill."</p>

    <p>So he came to the little red cottage at the edge of the wood
    wherein lived the wise woman who knew many things and one. Hans
    scraped his feet on the stones until they were clean, and then
    he knocked at the door.</p>

    <p>"Come in," said the old wise woman.</p>

    <p>She was as strange an old woman as one could hope
    <!-- Page 89 --><a name="Page_89"
       id="Page_89"></a>to see in a lifetime. Her nose bent down to
       meet her chin, and her chin bent up to reach her nose; her
       face was gray with great age, and her hair was as white as
       snow. She wore a long red cloak over her shoulders, and a
       great black cat sat on the back of her chair.</p>

    <p>"What do you want, Son Hans?" said she.</p>

    <p>"I want to find my luck, mother," said Hans.</p>

    <p>"Where did you lose it, Son Hans?" said she.</p>

    <p>"That I do not know, mother," said Hans.</p>

    <p>Then the old wise woman said "Hum-m-m!" in a very thoughtful
    voice, and Hans said nothing at all.</p>

    <p>After a while she spoke again. "Have you enough to eat?"
    said she.</p>

    <p>"Oh yes!" said Hans.</p>

    <p>"Have you enough to drink?" said she.</p>

    <p>"Plenty of water, enough of milk, but no beer," said
    Hans.</p>

    <p>"Have you enough clothes to cover you?" said she.</p>

    <p>"Oh yes!" said Hans.</p>

    <p>"Are you warm enough in winter?" said she.</p>

    <p>"Oh yes!" said Hans.</p>

    <p>"Then you had better leave well enough alone," said she,
    "for luck can give you nothing more."</p>

    <p>"But it might put money into my pocket," said Hans.</p>

    <p>"And it might take away the good things that you already
    have," said she.</p>

    <p>"All the same, I should like to find it again," said Hans;
    "if I could only lay my hands on it I might make good out of
    it, even if it is bad."</p>

    <p>"I doubt that," said the old wise woman. Neverthe
    <!-- Page 90 --><a name="Page_90"
       id="Page_90"></a>less, she saw that Hans was set in his own
       way, and that he only talked stiffness into his
       stubbornness. So she arose from her chair with much
       groaning, for her joints were stiffened with age, and
       limping to a closet in the wall she brought a book thence.
       Then she ran her finger down one page and up another, until
       she had found that which she sought. When she had found it
       she spoke:</p><br>

        <p class="caption">"Hans Hecklemann goes to the cottage of
        the old Wise Woman in search of his Luck."</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>"Son Hans, you lost your luck three years ago when you were
    coming from the fair at Kneitlingen. You sat down on the
    overturned cross that lies where three roads meet, and it fell
    out of your pocket along with a silver shilling. Now, Hans,
    your luck was evil, therefore it stuck to the good sign, as all
    evil things of that kind must, like a fly to butter. Also, I
    tell you this: when an evil manikin such as this touches the
    sign of the good cross, he becomes visible to the eyes of
    everybody who chooses to look upon him. Therefore go to the
    stone cross and you will find your luck running this way and
    that, but never able to get away from it." So say
    <!-- Page 91 --><a name="Page_91"
       id="Page_91"></a>ing, the old woman shut her book again.
       Then she arose from her chair and went once more to the
       closet in the wall. This time she took from it a little sack
       woven of black goat's hair. "When you have found your luck
       again, put it into this little bag," said she; "once in it,
       no evil imp will be able to get out again so long as you
       keep the strings tied. And now good-bye!"</p><br>


    <div class="ctr">
        <a id="Old_Wise-Woman"></a> <a href=
        "images/hansandoldfull.png"><img src=

        <p class="caption">"Hans Hecklemann and the Old
        Wise-Woman"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>Then Hans slipped the little sack into his pocket, and set
    out for the overturned stone cross where the three roads meet.
    When he had come to the place, he looked here and there, and
    this way and that, but for a long time he could
    <!-- Page 92 --><a name="Page_92"
       id="Page_92"></a>see nothing at all. At last, after much
       looking, he beheld a little black beetle running hither and
       thither on the stone. "I wonder," said Hans, "if this can be
       my luck."</p>

    <p>So saying, he caught the little beetle betwixt his finger
    and thumb, but very carefully, for he could not tell whether or
    not it might bite him. The beetle stuck to the stone as though
    it had been glued there, but, at last, Hans pulled it away;
    then&mdash;lo! it was not a beetle that he held in his hand,
    but a little manikin about as long as your thumb and as black
    as ink. Hans Hecklemann was so frightened that he nearly
    dropped it, for it kicked and screeched and rolled its red eyes
    in a very ugly way as he held it. However, he popped it into
    the little sack and pulled the strings tight, and there it was,
    safe and sound.</p>

    <p>That is what Hans Hecklemann's luck was like.</p>

    <p>So Hans having his luck secure in the little sack began to
    bargain with it. "What will you do for me if I let you out?"
    said he.</p>

    <p>"Nothing at all," snarled his luck.</p>

    <p>"Very well," said Hans, "we will see about that."</p>

    <p>So he carried it home with him, and threw sack and all into
    a nasty pot where Catherine cast the scrapings of the
    dishes&mdash;the fat and what not that she boiled down into
    soap now and then. There he left his luck to stay until the
    next day, and then he went to it again. "What will you do for
    me if I will let you out now?" said he.</p>

    <p>"Nothing at all," snarled his luck.</p>

    <p>"Very well," said Hans, "we will see about that." So he let
    him stay where he was for another day. And so the fiddle
    played; every day Hans Hecklemann went to his luck and asked it
    what it would give him if he would let
       <!-- Page 93 --><a name="Page_93"
       id="Page_93"></a>it out, and every day his luck said
       nothing; and so a week or more passed.</p><br>

    </div><br>


    <p>At last Hans's luck gave in.</p>

    <p>"See, Hans," it said one morning; "if you will let me out of
    this nasty pickle I will give you a thousand thalers."</p>

    <p>"Ah no!" said Hans. "Thalers are only thalers, as my good
    father used to say. They melt away like snow, and then nothing
    is left of them. I will trust no such luck as that!"</p>

    <p>"I will give you two thousand thalers," said his luck.</p>

        <p class="caption">"Hans Hecklemann ploughs for Gold"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>"Ah no!" said Hans; "two thousand thalers are only twice one
    thousand thalers. I will trust no such luck as that,
    either!"</p>

    <p>"Then what will you take to let me out, Hans Hecklemann?"
    said his luck.</p>

    <p>"Look," said Hans; "yonder stands my old plough. Now, if you
    will give me to find a golden noble at the end of every furrow
    that I strike with it I will let you out. If not&mdash;why,
    then, into the soap you go."</p>

    <p>"Done!" said Hans's luck.</p>

    <p>"Done!" said Hans.</p>

    <p>Then he opened the mouth of the sack, and&mdash;puff!
    <!-- Page 97 --><a name="Page_97"
       id="Page_97"></a>went his luck, like wind out of a bag,
       and&mdash;pop! it slipped into his breeches pocket.</p>

    <p>He never saw it again with his mortal eyes, but it stayed
    near to him, I can tell you. "Ha! ha! ha!" it laughed in his
    pocket, "you have made an ill bargain, Hans, I can tell
    you!"</p>

    <p>"Never mind," said Hans, "I am contented."</p>

    <p>Hans Hecklemann did not tarry long in trying the new luck of
    his old plough, as you may easily guess. Off he went like the
    wind and borrowed Fritz Friedleburg's old gray horse. Then he
    fastened the horse to the plough and struck the first furrow.
    When he had come to the end of it&mdash;pop! up shot a golden
    noble, as though some one had spun it up from the ground with
    his finger and thumb. Hans picked it up, and looked at it and
    looked at it as though he would swallow it with his eyes. Then
    he seized the handle of the plough and struck another
    furrow&mdash;pop! up went another golden noble, and Hans
    gathered it as he had done the other one. So he went on all of
    that day, striking furrows and gathering golden nobles until
    all of his pockets were as full as they could hold. When it was
    too dark to see to plough any more he took Fritz Friedleburg's
    horse back home again, and then he went home himself.</p>

    <p>All of his neighbors thought that he was crazy, for it was
    nothing but plough, plough, plough, morning and noon and night,
    spring and summer and autumn. Frost and darkness alone kept him
    from his labor. His stable was full of fine horses, and he
    worked them until they dropped in the furrows that he was
    always ploughing.</p>

    <p>"Yes; Hans is crazy," they all said; but when Hans
    <!-- Page 98 --><a name="Page_98"
       id="Page_98"></a>heard them talk in this way he only winked
       to himself and went on with his ploughing, for he felt that
       he knew this from that.</p>

    <p>But ill luck danced in his pocket with the golden nobles,
    and from the day that he closed his bargain with it he was an
    unhappy man. He had no comfort of living, for it was nothing
    but work, work, work. He was up and away at his ploughing at
    the first dawn of day, and he never came home till night had
    fallen; so, though he ploughed golden nobles, he did not turn
    up happiness in the furrows along with them. After he had eaten
    his supper he would sit silently behind the stove, warming his
    fingers and thinking of some quicker way of doing his
    ploughing. For it seemed to him that the gold-pieces came in
    very slowly, and he blamed himself that he had not asked his
    luck to let him turn up three at a time instead of only one at
    the end of each furrow; so he had no comfort in his gathering
    wealth. As day followed day he grew thin and haggard and worn,
    but seven boxes of bright new gold-pieces lay hidden in the
    cellar, of which nobody knew but himself. He told no one how
    rich he was growing, and all of his neighbors wondered why he
    did not starve to death.</p>

    <p>So you see the ill luck in his breeches pocket had the best
    of the bargain, after all.</p>

    <p>After Hans had gone the way of all men, his heirs found the
    chests full of gold in the cellar, and therewith they bought
    fat lands and became noblemen and gentlemen; but that made
    Hans's luck none the better.</p>

    <p>From all this I gather:</p>

    <p><!-- Page 99 --><a name="Page_99"
       id="Page_99"></a> That few folks can turn ill luck into good
       luck.<br>
     That the best thing for one to do is to let well enough
    alone.<br>
     That one cannot get happiness as one does
    cabbages&mdash;with<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">money.</span><br>
     That happiness is the only good luck, after all!</p>

    <h2>YE SONG OF YE RAJAH &amp; YE FLY</h2>

    <p>Great and rich beyond comparing<br>
     Was the Rajah Rhama Jaring,<br>
     As he went to take an airing<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">With his Court one summer
    day.</span><br>
     All were gay with green and yellow;<br>
     And a little darky fellow<br>
     Bore a monstrous fun umbrella,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">For to shade him on the
    way.</span><br>
    <br>
     Now a certain fly, unwitting<br>
     Of this grandeur, came a-flitting<br>
     To the Royal nose, and sitting<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Twirled his legs upon the
    same.</span><br>
     Then the Rajah's eyes blazed fire<br>
     At the insult, and the ire<br>
     In his heart boiled high and higher.<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Slap! he struck, but missed
    his aim.</span><br>
    <br>
     Then all trembled at this passion,<br>
     For he spoke in furious fashion.<br>
     "Saw ye how yon fly did dash on<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">To our august nose!" he
    said.</span><br>
     "Now let all within our nation<br>
     Wage a war without cessation<br>
     War of b-lood, ex-ter-mi-nation,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until every fly is
    dead!!!!"</span><br>
    <br>
     Now the while this war was raging,<br>
     That the rajah was a-waging,<br>
     Things that should have been engaging<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">His attention went to
    pot.</span><br>
     So he came at last to begging,<br>
     Though the flies continued plaguing.<br>
     For it's not so easy pegging<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out vexation thus, I
    wot.</span><br>
    <br>
     From this you may see what all have to expect,<br>
     Who, fighting small troubles, great duties neglect.<br>

    <h2>PRIDE IN DISTRESS</h2>

    <p>Mistress Polly Poppenjay<br>
     Went to take a walk one day.<br>
     On that morning she was dressed<br>
     In her very Sunday best;<br>
     Feathers, frills and ribbons gay,&mdash;<br>
     Proud was Mistress Poppenjay.<br>
    <br>
     Mistress Polly Poppenjay<br>
     Spoke to no one on her way;<br>
     Passed acquaintances aside;<br>
     Held her head aloft with pride;<br>
     Did not see a puddle lay<br>
     In front of Mistress Poppenjay.<br>
    <br>
     Mistress Polly Poppenjay<br>
     Harked to naught the folk could say.<br>
     Loud they cried, "Beware the puddle!"<br>
     <i>Plump!</i> She stepped into the middle.<br>
     And a pretty plight straightway<br>
     Was poor Mistress Poppenjay.<br>
    <br>
     Mistress Polly Poppenjay;<br>
     From your pickle others may<br>
     Learn to curb their pride a little;&mdash;<br>
     Learn to exercise their wit, till<br>
     They are sure no puddles may<br>
     Lie in front, Miss Poppenjay.<br>

    <h2>PROFESSION &amp; PRACTICE</h2>

    <p>Once, when Saint Swithin chanced to be<br>
     A-wandering in Hungary,<br>
     He, being hungered, cast around<br>
     To see if something might be found<br>
     To stay his stomach.<br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">Near by stood</span><br>
     A little house, beside a wood,<br>
     Where dwelt a worthy man, but poor.<br>
     Thither he went, knocked at the door.<br>
     The good man came. Saint Swithin said,<br>
     "I prithee give a crust of bread<br>
     To ease my hunger."<br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 12em;">"Brother," quoth</span><br>
     The good man, "I am sadly loath<br>
     To say" (here tears stood on his cheeks)<br>
     "I've had no bread for weeks and weeks,<br>
     Save what I've begged. Had I one bit,<br>
     I'd gladly give thee half of it."<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"How," said the Saint, "can
    one so good</span><br>
     Go lacking of his daily food,<br>
     Go lacking means to aid the poor,<br>
     Yet weep to turn them from his door?<br>
     Here&mdash;take this purse. Mark what I say:<br>
     Thou'lt find within it every day<br>
     Two golden coins."<br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">Years passed. Once
    more</span><br>
     Saint Swithin knocked upon the door.<br>
     The good man came. He'd grown fat<br>
     And lusty, like a well-fed cat.<br>
     Thereat the Saint was pleased. Quoth he,<br>
     "Give me a crust for charity."<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"A crust, thou say'st? Hut,
    tut! How now?</span><br>
     Wouldst come a-begging here? I trow,<br>
     Thou lazy rascal, thou couldst find<br>
     Enough of work hadst thou a mind!<br>
     'Tis thine own fault if thou art poor.<br>
     Begone, sir!" <i>Bang!</i>&mdash;he shut the door.<br>
    <br>
     Saint Swithin slowly scratched his head.<br>
     "Well, I <i>am</i>&mdash;humph!&mdash;just so," he said.<br>
     "How very different the fact is<br>
     'Twixt the profession and the practice!"<br>

    <h2>A TALE OF A TUB</h2><span style=

     <br>


    <p>You may bring to mind I've sung you a song,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of a man of Haarlem
    town.</span><br>
     I'll sing of another,&mdash;'t will not take long&mdash;,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of equally great
    renown.</span><br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 7em;">2</span><br>
    <br>
     "I've read," said he, "there's a land afar,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er the boundless rolling
    sea,</span><br>
     Where fat little pigs ready roasted are:<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now, that is the land for
    me.</span><br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 7em;">3</span><br>
    <br>
     Where tarts may be plucked from the wild tart tree,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And puddings like pumpkins
    grow,</span><br>
     Where candies, like pebbles, lie by the sea,&mdash;<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now, thither I'll straightway
    go."</span><br>

     <span style="margin-left: 7em;">4</span><br>
    <br>
     Now, what do you think I've heard it said<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was his boat, his oar, his
    sail?</span><br>
     A tub, a spoon, and a handkerchief red,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">For to breast both calm and
    gale.</span><br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 7em;">5</span><br>
    <br>
     So he sailed away, for a livelong day;<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the sun was warm and
    mild,</span><br>
     And the small waves laughed as they seemed to play,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the sea-gulls clamored
    wild.</span><br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 7em;">6</span><br>
    <br>
     So he sailed away, for a livelong day;<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till the wind began to
    roar,</span><br>
     And the waves rose high, and, to briefly say,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">He never was heard of
    more.</span><br>

    <p>Did you ever hear of a boggart? No! Then I will tell you. A
    boggart is a small imp that lives in a man's house, unseen by
    any one, doing a little good and much harm. This imp was called
    a boggart in the old times, now we call such by other
    names&mdash;ill-temper, meanness, uncharitableness, and the
    like. Even now, they say, you may find a boggart in some
    houses. There is no placing reliance on a boggart; sometimes he
    may seem to be of service to his master, but there is no
    telling when he may do him an ill turn.</p>

    <p>Rap! tap! tap! came a knock at the door.</p>

    <p>The wind was piping Jack Frost's, for the time was winter,
    and it blew from the north. The snow lay all over the ground,
    like soft feathers, and the hay-ricks looked as though each one
    wore a dunce-cap, like the dull boy in Dame Week's school over
    by the green. The icicles hung down by the thatch, and the
    little birds crouched shivering in the bare and leafless
    hedge-rows.</p>

    <p>But inside the farm-house all was warm and pleasant; the
    great logs snapped and crackled and roared in the wide
    chimney-place, throwing red light up and down the walls, so
    that the dark night only looked in through the latticed
    <!-- Page 103 --><a name="Page_103"
       id="Page_103"></a>windows. Farmer Griggs sat warming his
       knees at the blaze, smoking his pipe in great comfort, while
       his crock of ale, with three roasted crab-apples bobbing
       about within it, warmed in the hot ashes beside the blazing
       logs, simmering pleasantly in the ruddy heat.</p><br>


    <div class="ctr">
        <a id="Farmer_Georgie_Griggs"></a> <a href=

             title="Farmer Georgie Griggs"></a>

        <p class="caption">"Farmer Georgie Griggs"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>Dame Griggs's spinning-wheel went humm-m-m! hum-m-m-m-m!
    like a whole hiveful of bees, the cat purred
    <!-- Page 104 --><a name="Page_104"
       id="Page_104"></a>in the warmth, the dog basked in the
       blaze, and little red sparks danced about the dishes
       standing all along in a row on the dresser.</p>

    <p>But, rap! tap! tap! came a knock at the door.</p>

    <p>Then Farmer Griggs took his pipe from out his mouth. "Did'ee
    hear un, dame?" said he. "Zooks now, there be somebody outside
    the door."</p>

    <p>"Well then, thou gert oaf, why don't 'ee let un in?" said
    Dame Griggs.</p>

    <p>"Look'ee now," said Georgie Griggs to himself, "sure women
    be of quicker wits than men!" So he opened the door. Whoo! In
    rushed the wind, and the blaze of the logs made as though it
    would leap up the chimney for fear.</p>

    <p>"Will you let me in out of the cold, Georgie Griggs?" piped
    a small voice. Farmer Griggs looked down and saw a little wight
    no taller than his knee standing in the snow on the door-step.
    His face was as brown as a berry, and he looked up at the
    farmer with great eyes as bright as those of a toad. The red
    light of the fire shone on him, and Georgie Griggs saw that his
    feet were bare and that he wore no coat.</p>

    <p>"Who be 'ee, little man?" said Farmer Griggs.</p>

    <p>"I'm a boggart, at your service."</p>

    <p>"Na, na," said Farmer Griggs, "thee's at na sarvice o'mine.
    I'll give na room in my house to the likes o' thee"; and he
    made as though he would have shut the door in the face of the
    little urchin.</p>

    <p>"But listen, Georgie Griggs," said the boggart; "I will do
    you a good service."</p>

    <p><!-- Page 105 --><a name="Page_105"
       id="Page_105"></a>Then Farmer Griggs did listen. "What
       sarvice will'ee do me, then?" said he.</p><br>

    <p>"I'll tend your fires," said the manikin, "I'll bake your

    your floors, I'll brew your beer, I'll roast your meat, I'll

       in your house, so that you will not have to give so much as
       a groat for wages to cook, scullion, or serving

        <p class="caption">"Farmer Griggs and the Boggart."</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>Then Farmer Griggs listened a little longer without shutting
    the door, and so did Dame Griggs. "What's thy name, boggart?"
    said he.</p>

    <p>"Hardfist," said the boggart; and he came a little farther
    in at the door, for he saw that Farmer Griggs had a mind to let
    him in all of the way.</p>

    <p>"I don't know," said Georgie Griggs, scratching his head
    doubtfully; "it's an ill thing, lettin' mischief intull the
    house! Thee's better outside, I doubt."</p>

    <p>"Shut the door, Georgie!" called out Dame Griggs; "thou'rt
    lettin' th' cold air intull th' room."</p>

    <p>Then Farmer Griggs shut the door, but the boggart was on the
    inside.</p>

    <p>This is the way in which the boggart came into Farmer
    Griggs's house, and there he was to stay, for it is no such
    easy matter getting rid of the likes of him when we once let
    him in, I can tell you.</p>

    <p>The boggart came straightway over to the warm fire, and the
    dog growled&mdash;"chur-r-r-r!"&mdash;and showed his teeth, and
    the cat spit anger and jumped up on the dresser, with her back
    arched and her tail on end. But the boggart cared never a whit
    for this, but laid himself comfortably down among the warm
    ashes.</p>

    <p>Now imps, like this boggart, can only be seen as the frost
    is seen&mdash;when it is cold. So as he grew warmer and
    <!-- Page 108 --><a name="Page_108"
       id="Page_108"></a>warmer, he grew thin, like a jelly-fish,
       and at last, when he had become thoroughly warmed through,
       Farmer Griggs and the dame could see him no more than though
       he was thin air. But he was in the house, and he stayed
       there, I can tell you. For a time everything went as smooth
       as cream; all of the work of the house was done as though by
       magic, for the boggart did all that he had promised; he made
       the fires, he baked the bread, he washed the dishes, he
       scoured the pans, he scrubbed the floors, he brewed the
       beer, he roasted the meat, he stuffed the sausages, he
       skimmed the milk, he made the butter, he pressed the cheese,
       he plucked the geese, he spun the thread, he knit the
       stockings, he mended the clothes, he patched the
       shoes&mdash;he was everywhere and did all of the work of the
       house. When Farmer Griggs saw these things done, and so
       deftly, he rubbed his hands and chuckled to himself. He sent
       cook and scullion and serving maid a-packing, there being
       nothing for them to do, for, as I said, all of these things
       were done as smooth as cream. But after a time, and when the
       boggart's place had become easy to him, like an old shoe,
       mischief began to play the pipes and he began to show his
       pranks. The first thing that he did was to scrape the
       farmer's butter, so that it was light of weight, and all of
       the people of the market town hooted at him for giving less
       than he sold. Then he skimmed the children's milk, so that
       they had nothing but poor watery stuff to pour over their
       pottage of a morning. He took the milk from the cat, so that
       it was like to starve; he even pilfered the bones and
       scrapings of the dishes from the poor house-dog, as though
       he was a very magpie. He blew out the rush-lights, so that
       <!-- Page 109 --><a name="Page_109"
       id="Page_109"></a>they were all in the dark after sunset; he
       made the fires burn cold, and played a hundred and forty
       other impish tricks of the like kind. As for the poor little
       children, they were always crying and complaining that the
       boggart did this and the boggart did that; that he scraped
       the butter from their bread and pulled the coverlids off of
       them at night.</p>

    <p>Still the boggart did his work well, and so Farmer Griggs
    put up with his evil ways as long as he could. At last the time
    came when he could bear it no longer. "Look'ee, now, Mally,"
    said he to his dame, "it's all along o' thee that this
    trouble's coome intull th' house. I'd never let the boggart in
    with my own good-will!" So spoke Farmer Griggs, for even
    nowadays there are men here and there who will now and then lay
    their own bundle of faults on their wives' shoulders.</p>

    <p>"I bade thee do naught but shut the door!" answered Dame
    Griggs.</p>

    <p>"Ay; it's easy enough to shut the door after the trouble's
    come in!"</p>

    <p>"Then turn it out again!"</p>

    <p>"Turn un out! Odds bodkins, that's woman's wit! Dost'ee not
    see that there's no turnin' o' un out? Na, na; there's naught
    to do but to go out ourselves!"</p>

    <p>Yes; there was nothing else to be done. Go they must, if
    they would be rid of the boggart. So one fine bright day in the
    blessed spring-time, they packed all of their belongings into a
    great wain, or cart, and set off to find a new home.</p>

    <p>Oft they trudged, just as you see in the picture, the
    <!-- Page 112 --><a name="Page_112"
       id="Page_112"></a>three little children seated high up in
       the wain, and the farmer and the dame plodding
       ahead.</p><br>

    <p>Now, as they came to the bottom of Shooter's Hill, whom
    should they meet but their good neighbor and gossip, Jerry
    Jinks. "So, Georgie," said he, "you're leavin' th' ould house
    at last?"</p>

    <p>"High, Jerry," quoth Georgie. "We were forced tull it,
    neighbor, for that black boggart torments us so that there was
    no rest night or day for it. The poor bairns' stomachs are
    empty, and the good dame's nigh dead for it.
    <!-- Page 114 --><a name="Page_114"
       id="Page_114"></a>So off we go, like th' field-fares in the
       autumn&mdash;we're flittin', we're flittin'!"</p>

    <p>Now on the wain was a tall, upright churn; as soon as
    Georgie had ended his speech, the lid of the churn began to
    clipper-clapper, and who should speak out of it but the boggart
    himself. "Ay, Jerry!" said he, "we're a flittin', we're a
    flittin', man! Good-day to ye, neighbor, good-day to ye! Come
    and see us soon time!"</p>

    <p>"High!" cried Georgie Griggs, "art thou there, thou black
    imp? Dang un! We'll all go back tull th' old house, for sure
    it's better to bear trouble there than in a new place."</p>

    <p>So back they went again&mdash;boggart and all.</p>

    <p>By this you may see, my dear, if you warm an imp by your
    fire, he will soon turn the whole house topsy-turvy. Likewise,
    one cannot get rid of a boggart by going from here to there,
    for it is sure to be in the cart with the household things.</p>

    <p>But how did Georgie Griggs get rid of his boggart? That I
    will tell you.</p>

    <p>He went to Father Grimes, the wise man, who lived on in a
    little house on the moor. "Father Grimes," said he, "how shall
    I get rid of my boggart?"</p>

    <p>Then Father Grimes told him to take this and that, and to do
    thus and so with them, and see what followed. So Farmer Griggs
    went to Hugh the tailor's, and told him to make a pretty red
    coat and a neat pair of blue breeches. Then he went to William
    the hatter's, and bade him to make a nice little velvet cap
    with a bell at the top of it. Then he went to Thomas the
    shoemaker's, and bade him to make a fine little pair of shoes.
    So they all did as he <!-- Page 115 --><a name="Page_115"
       id="Page_115"></a>told them, and after these things were
       made he took them home with him. He laid them on a warm spot
       on the hearth where the boggart used to come to sleep at
       night. Then he and his dame hid in the closet to see what
       would follow.</p>

    <p>Presently came the boggart, whisking here and dancing there,
    though neither the farmer nor the dame could see him any more
    than though he had been a puff of wind.</p>

    <p>"Heigh-ho!" cried the boggart, "these be fine things for
    sure." So saying, he tried the hat upon his head, and it fitted
    exactly. Then he tried the coat on his shoulders, and it fitted
    like wax. Then he tried the breeches on his legs, and they
    fitted as though they grew there. Then he tried the shoes on
    his feet, and there never was such a fit. So he was clad in all
    his new clothes from top to toe, whereupon he began dancing
    until he made the ashes on the hearth spin around with him as
    though they had gone mad, and, as he danced, he sang:</p>

    <p>"Cap for the head, alas poor head!<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Coat for the back, alas poor
    back!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Breeks for the legs, alas
    poor legs!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Shoen for the feet, alas
    poor feet!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If these be mine, mine
    cannot be</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The house of honest man,
    Georgie!"</span></p>

    <p>So he went singing and dancing, and skipping and leaping,
    out of the house and away. As for Georgie Griggs and his dame,
    they never heard a squeak from him afterwards.</p>

    <p>Thus it was that Farmer Griggs got rid of his boggart. All I
    can say is, that if I could get rid of mine as easily
    <!-- Page 118 --><a name="Page_118"
       id="Page_118"></a>(for I have one in my own house), I would
       make him a suit of clothes of the finest silks and satins,
       and would hang a bell of pure silver on the point of his
       cap. But, alackaday! there are no more wise men left to us,
       like good Father Grimes, to tell one an easy way to get rid
       of one's boggart.</p><br>

    <h2>YE STORY OF A BLUE CHINA PLATE.</h2><span style=
    "margin-left: 1em;">There was a Cochin Chinaman,</span> <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Whose name it was
    Ah-Lee</span> <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the same was just as fine
    a man</span> <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">As you could wish to
    see,</span> <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 3em;">For he was rich and
    strong,</span> <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 3em;">And his queue was extra
    long,</span> <br>


    <p>And he lived on rice and fish and chiccory.<br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which he had a lovely
    daughter,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And her name was
    Mai-Ri-An,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the youthful Wang who
    sought her</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hand was but a poor young
    man;</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">So her haughty father
    said,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">"You shall never, never
    wed</span><br>
     Such a pauper as this penniless young man!"<br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">So the daughter and her
    lover,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">They eloped one summer
    day,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which Ah-Lee he did
    discover,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And pursued without
    delay;</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 3em;">But the Goddess Loo, I've
    heard,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Changed each lover to a
    bird,</span><br>
     And from the bad Ah-Lee they flew away.<br>
    <br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah me! Ah-Lee; the chance
    is,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">That we all of us may
    know</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of unpleasant
    circumstances</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">We would like to stay, but

     <span style="margin-left: 3em;">The inevitable

     <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Will take unto them
    wings,</span><br>
     And will fly where we may never hope to go.<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 3em;">I would further like to
    state,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 3em;">That the tale which I
    relate,</span><br>

    <h2>MORAL BLINDNESS</h2>

    <p>There was an old woman, as I've heard say,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who owned but a single
    goose.</span><br>
     And the dame lived over toward Truxton way,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the animal ran at
    loose.</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">It cackled up and it cackled
    down,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Disturbing the peace of all
    the town:</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gentle and simple, knight and
    clown,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">From the dawn to the close of
    the day.</span><br>
    <br>
     Another old woman, of not much note,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lived over toward Truxton
    way,</span><br>
     Who owned a goat with a shaggy black coat,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">As I've heard the neighbours
    say.</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And it was the fear of one and
    all;</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Butting the great, butting the
    small,&mdash;</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">No matter whom,&mdash;who
    happened to fall</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the way of this evil
    goat.</span><br>
    <br>
     Said the first old woman, "This ugly goat<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Should never thus run at
    loose."</span><br>
     Said the second, "I wish they'd cut the throat<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of that noisy cackling
    goose."</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so it happened when e'er
    that they</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would meet each other upon the
    way</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">They'd bicker and hicker the
    livelong day</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the key of a scolding
    note.</span><br>
    <br>
     But all the neighbours, great and small,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Complained of both with
    grievous tone.</span><br>
     From which I gather that we all<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">See other's faults and not our
    own.</span><br>

     For it chanced that none in ye town at all<br>

     If you'd have been there perhaps you'd have heard<br>

    <p>Once there was a prince, and his name was John. One day his
    father said to him, "See, John; I am growing old, and after a
    while the time will come when I must go the way of everybody
    else. Now I would like to see you married before I leave
    you."</p>

    <p>"Very well," said the Prince, for he always answered the
    King in seemly fashion; "and who shall it be?"</p>

    <p>"Why not the Princess of the White Mountain?" said the old
    King.</p>

    <p>"Why not, indeed?" said the young Prince, "only she is too
    short."</p>

    <p>"Why not the Princess of the Blue Mountain?" said the old
    King.</p>

    <p>"Why not, indeed?" said the young Prince, "only she is too
    tall."</p>

    <p>"Why not the Princess of the Red Mountain?" said the old
    King.</p>

    <p>"Why not, indeed?" said the young Prince, "only she is too
    dark."</p>

    <p>"Then whom will you have?" said the old King.</p>

    <p>"<!-- Page 120 --><a name="Page_120"
       id="Page_120"></a>That I do not know," said the young
       Prince, "only this: that her brow shall be as white as milk,
       and her cheeks shall be as red as blood, and her eyes shall
       be as blue as the skies, and her hair shall be like spun
       gold."</p>

    <p>"Then go and find her!" said the old King, in a huff, for
    his temper was as short as chopped flax. "And don't come back
    again till you've found her!" he bawled after the Prince as he
    went out to the door.</p>

    <p>So the Prince went out into the wide world to find such a
    maiden as he spoke of&mdash;whose brow was as white as milk,
    whose cheeks were as red as blood, whose eyes were as blue as
    the skies, and whose hair was like spun gold&mdash;and he would
    have to travel a long distance to find such a one nowadays,
    would he not?</p>

    <p>So off he went, tramp! tramp! tramp! till his shoes were
    dusty and his clothes were gray. Nothing was in his wallet but
    a lump of brown bread and a cold sausage, for he had gone out
    into the world in haste, as many a one has done before and
    since his day.</p>

    <p>So he went along, tramp! tramp! tramp! and by-and-by he came
    to a place where three roads met, and there sat an old
    woman.</p>

    <p>"Hui! hui! but I am hungry!" said the old woman.</p>

    <p>Now the Prince was a good-hearted fellow, so he said to the
    old woman, "It is little I have, but such as it is you are
    welcome to it." Thereupon he gave the old woman the lump of
    brown bread and the cold sausage that was in his wallet, and
    the old woman ate it up at a bite.</p>

    <p>"Hui! hui! but I am cold!" said she.</p>

    <p>"It is little that I have, but such as it is you are welcome
    to it," said the Prince, and he gave the old woman
    <!-- Page 121 --><a name="Page_121"
       id="Page_121"></a>the dusty coat off his back. After that he
       had nothing more to give her.</p><br>

    <p>"One does not give something for nothing," said the old
    woman, so she began fumbling about in her pocket until she
    found an old rusty key. And the best part of the key was, that
    whenever one looked through the ring of it, one saw everything
    just as it really was and not as it seemed to be.</p>

    <p><!-- Page 122 --><a name="Page_122"
       id="Page_122"></a>Who would not give his dinner and the coat
       off his back for such a key?</p>

    <p>After that the Prince stepped out again, right foot
    foremost, tramp! tramp! tramp! until evening had come, and he
    felt as hungry as one is like to do when one goes without one's
    dinner. At last he came to a dark forest, and to a gray castle
    that stood just in the middle of it. This castle belonged to a
    great, ugly troll, though the Prince knew nothing of that.</p>

    <p>"Now I shall have something to eat," said he, and he opened
    the door of the castle and went in.</p>

    <p>Only one person was within, and that was a maiden; but she
    was as black from head to foot as Fritz the charcoal burner.
    The Prince had never seen the like of her in all of his life
    before, so he drew the rusty key out of his pocket and took a
    peep at her through the ring of it, to see what manner of body
    she really was.</p>

    <p>Then he saw that she was no longer black and ugly, but as
    beautiful as a ripe apple; for her forehead was as white as
    milk, her cheeks were as red as blood, her eyes were as blue as
    the skies, and her hair was like spun gold. Moreover, any one
    could see with half an eye that she was a real princess, for
    she wore a gold crown on her head, such as real princesses are
    never without.</p>

    <p>"You are the one whom I seek," said the Prince.</p>

    <p>"Yes, I am the one you seek," said she.</p>

    <p>"And how can I free you from your enchantment?" said he.</p>

    <p>"If you will abide here three nights, and will bear all that
    shall happen to you without a word, then I shall be free," said
    she.</p>

    <p>"<!-- Page 123 --><a name="Page_123"
       id="Page_123"></a>Oh yes, I will do that," said the
       Prince.</p>

    <p>After that the black Princess set a good supper before him,
    and the Prince ate like three men.</p>

    <p>By-and-by there was a huge noise, and the door opened and in
    came an ugly troll with a head as big as a bucket. He rolled
    his great saucer eyes around till he saw the Prince where he
    sat beside the fire.</p><br>

    </div><br>


    <p>"Black cats and spotted toads!" bellowed he, "what are you
    doing here?"</p>

    <p>But to this the Prince answered never a word.</p>

    <p>"<!-- Page 124 --><a name="Page_124"
       id="Page_124"></a>We shall see whether or no there is sound
       in you!" roared the troll. Thereupon he caught the Prince by
       the hair and dragged him out into the middle of the room.
       Then he snatched up a great cudgel and began beating the
       Prince as though he were a sack of barley-flour; but the
       Prince said never a word. At last the troll had to give over
       beating him, for the morning had come and the troll was
       afraid the sun would catch him; and if that were to happen,
       he would swell up and burst with a great noise. "We shall
       see whether you will come again!" said he, and then he left
       the Prince lying on the floor more dead than alive; and if
       anybody was sore in all of the world, the Prince was that
       man.</p>

    <p>After the troll had left the house, the black Princess came
    and wept over the Prince; and when her tears fell on him, pain
    and bruise left him, and he was as whole as ever. When he
    looked he saw that the black Princess's feet were as white as
    silver.</p>

    <p>The next night the troll came again, and with him two
    others. "Black cats and spotted toads!" bellowed he, "are you
    here again?" Then he caught the Prince by the hair and dragged
    him out into the middle of the floor, and all three of the
    trolls fell upon the Prince and beat him with clubs, as though
    he had been a sack of barley-flour. But the Prince bore this
    too without a word. At last the morning came, and they had to
    give over beating him. "We shall see if you will come again,"
    said the troll of the house.</p>

    <p>After the trolls had gone, the black Princess came and wept
    over the Prince as she had done before, and when her tears fell
    on him he was made whole again. <!-- Page 125 --><a name=
    "Page_125"
       id="Page_125"></a>And now the hands of the black Princess
       were as white as silver.</p><br>

    <p>The third night the troll of the house came, and brought
    with him six others. Then the same thing happened as before,
    and they beat the Prince with great cudgels as thick as my
    thumb. At last the morning came, and they went away bellowing
    and howling, for their enchantment had gone. As for the Prince,
    he lay upon the floor more dead than alive, for he could
    neither see nor hear anything that happened about him.</p>

    <p>Then the Princess came for the third time and wept over him,
    and he was whole and sound again. As for
    <!-- Page 126 --><a name="Page_126"
       id="Page_126"></a>the Princess, she stood before him, and
       now her brow was as white as milk, and her cheeks were as
       red as blood, and her eyes were as blue as the skies, and
       her hair was like spun gold. But the beautiful Princess had
       little or nothing upon her, so the Prince wrapped her in a
       ram's skin that was in the troll's house. Then he turned his
       toes the way he had come, and started away for home, taking
       her along with him.</p>

    <p>So they went along and along till they had come so near to
    the King's house that they could see the high roofs and the
    weathercocks over the crest of the next hill. There the Prince
    bade the Princess to wait for him till he went home and brought
    her a dress of real silver and gold, such as was fitting for
    her to wear. Then he left her, and the Princess sat down beside
    the roadside to wait until he should come again.</p>

    <p>Now as the Princess sat there, there came along the old
    goose-herd of the palace, and with her came her daughter; for
    they were driving the royal geese home again from where they
    had been eating grass. When they saw the beautiful Princess,
    clad in her ram's hide, they stared as though they would never
    shut their eyes again. Then they wanted to know all about
    her&mdash;who she was, and where she came from, and what she
    sat there for. So the Princess told them all that they wanted
    to know, and that she waited there for the Prince to come with
    a dress all of silver and gold, which would suit her better
    than the old ram's hide which she wore.</p>

    <p>Then the old goose-woman thought that it would be a fine
    thing to have her daughter in the Princess's place, so that she
    might have the dress of real silver and gold,
    <!-- Page 127 --><a name="Page_127"
       id="Page_127"></a>and marry the Prince. So the goose-herd's
       daughter held the Princess, and the old goose-herd stripped
       the ram's hide off from her.</p>

    <p>No sooner had they done this than the Princess was changed
    into a beautiful golden bird, and flew away over hill and over
    valley. Then the goose-herd's daughter clad herself in the
    ram's hide, and sat down in the Princess's place.</p><br>


    <div class="ctr">

        <p class="caption">"The Gooseherd &amp; her Daughter meet
        the Princess at the Roadside"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>"Yes, my pretty little bird," said the old goose-herd, "thou
    wilt make a fine Princess!" But, prut! she was no more like a
    Princess than I am, for she was squat, and round-shouldered,
    and had hair of the color of tow.</p>

    <p>Then the old goose-herd drove her geese away, and the
    goose-girl waited for the coming of the Prince.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, after a while the Prince came with a fine
    dress, all of real silver and gold; but when he saw the
    goose-girl he beat his head with his knuckles, for he thought
    that it was the Princess, and that she was enchanted again.</p>

    <p><!-- Page 128 --><a name="Page_128"
       id="Page_128"></a>Why did he not look through the ring of
       his magic key?</p>

    <p>Perhaps for this, perhaps for that&mdash;one cannot be
    always wise.</p><br>


    <div class="ctr">
        <a id="Magic_Key"></a> <a href=
        "images/princemagickeyfull.png"><img src=

        <p class="caption">"The Prince looks through the Magic
        Key."</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>Then the Prince dressed the goose-girl in the fine dress of
    gold and silver, and took her home with him. Hui! how everybody
    stared and laughed when they saw what kind of a Princess it was
    that the Prince brought home with him! As for the poor old
    King, he <!-- Page 129 --><a name="Page_129"
       id="Page_129"></a>rubbed his spectacles and looked and
       looked, for he thought that this was a strange sort of a
       wife for the Prince to make such a buzz about. However, he
       said nothing, for he thought to himself that perhaps she
       would grow prettier by-and-by.</p>

    <p>So orders were given for a grand wedding on Thursday, and
    the old King asked all of the neighbors to come, and even those
    who lived at a distance, for this was to be a very grand
    wedding indeed.</p>

    <p>But the old goose-herd told her daughter to mix a sleeping
    powder with the Prince's wine at supper, for, if the real
    Princess were to come at all, she would come that night. So the
    goose-girl did as she was told, and the Prince drank the
    sleeping powder with his wine, and knew nothing of it.</p>

    <p>That night the golden bird came flying, and sat in the
    linden tree just outside of the Prince's chamber window. Then
    she clapped her wings and sang:</p>

    <p>"I wept over you once,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I wept over you
    twice,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I wept over you three
    times.</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In the ram's skin I
    waited,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And out of the ram's skin I
    flew.</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Why are you
    sleeping,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Life of my life?"</span></p>

    <p>But the Prince slept as sound as a dormouse, and when the
    dawn came and the cocks crew the golden bird was forced to fly
    away.</p>

    <p>The next night the false Princess did as she had done
    before, and mixed a sleeping powder with the Prince's cup of
    wine.</p>

    <p><!-- Page 130 --><a name="Page_130"
       id="Page_130"></a>That night the golden bird came again, and
       perched in the linden tree outside of the Prince's window,
       and sang:</p>

    <p>"I wept over you once,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I wept over you
    twice,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I wept over you three
    times.</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In the ram's skin I
    waited,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And out of the ram's skin I
    flew.</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Why are you
    sleeping,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Life of my life?"</span></p>

    <p>But once more the Prince slept through it all, and when
    morning had come the golden bird was forced to fly away.</p>

    <p>Now it chanced that that night some of the folk of the
    King's household heard the bird singing, and they told the
    Prince all about it. So when the third night came, and the
    false Princess gave the Prince the cup of wine with the
    sleeping powder in it, he threw the wine over his shoulder, and
    never touched so much as a drop of it.</p>

    <p>That night the bird came for the third time, and sang as it
    had done before.</p>

    <p>But this time the Prince was not sleeping. He jumped out of
    his bed and ran to the window, and there he saw the bird, and
    its feathers shone like fire because they were of pure gold.
    Then he got his magic key and looked through the ring of it,
    and whom should he see but his own Princess sitting in the
    linden tree.</p>

    <p>Then the Prince called to her, "What shall I do to set you
    free from this enchantment?"</p>

    <p>"Throw your knife over me," said the Princess.</p>

    <p><!-- Page 131 --><a name="Page_131"
       id="Page_131"></a>No sooner said than done. The Prince threw
       his knife over her, and there she stood in her own true
       shape. Then the Prince took her to the King, and when the
       King saw how pretty she was, he skipped and danced till his
       slippers flew about his ears.</p>

    <p>The next morning the old King went to the false Princess,
    and said, "What should be done to one who would do thus and
    so?"</p><br>

    <p>To this the false Princess answered, as bold as brass, "Such
    a one should be thrown into a pit full of toads and
    snakes."</p>

    <p>"You have spoken for yourself," said the King; and he would
    have done just so to her had not the true Princess begged for
    her so that she was sent back again to tend the geese, for that
    was what she was fit for.</p>

    <p>Then they had the grandest wedding that ever was seen in all
    of the world. Everybody was asked, and there was enough for all
    to eat as much as they chose, and to
       <!-- Page 132 --><a name="Page_132"
       id="Page_132"></a>take a little something home to the
       children beside. If I had been there I would have brought
       you something.</p>

    <h2>YE SAD STORY CONCERNING ON INNOCENT LITTLE <i>LAMB</i> AND
    FOUR WICKED <i>WOLVES</i></h2>

    <p>A little lamb was gamboling,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Upon a pleasant
    day,</span><br>
     And four grey wolves came shambling,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And stopped to see it
    play</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 3em;">In the sun.</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said the lamb, "Perhaps I
    may</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Charm these creatures with my
    play,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they'll let me go
    away,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 3em;">When I've done."</span><br>
    <br>
     The wolves, they sat asmiling at<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">The playful thing, to
    see</span><br>
     How exceedingly beguiling that<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Its pretty play could
    be.</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 3em;">See it hop!</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">But its strength began to
    wane,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though it gamboled on in
    pain,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till it finally was
    fain,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 3em;">For to stop.</span><br>
    <br>
     Oh! then there was a munching,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of that tender little
    thing,</span><br>
     And a crunching and a scrunching,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">As you'ld munch a chicken
    wing.</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 3em;">No avail</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was its cunning, merry
    play</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the only thing, they
    say,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 1em;">That was left of it that
    day,</span><br>
     <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Was its tail.</span><br>

    <p>There was a woman once, and she had three daughters. The
    first daughter squinted with both eyes, yet the woman loved her
    as she loved salt, for she herself squinted with both eyes. The
    second daughter had one shoulder higher than the other, and
    eyebrows as black as soot in the chimney, yet the woman loved
    her as well as she loved the other, for she herself had black
    eyebrows and one shoulder higher than the other. The youngest
    daughter was as pretty as a ripe apple, and had hair as fine as
    silk and the color of pure gold, but the woman loved her not at
    all, for, as I have said, she herself was neither pretty, nor
    had she hair of the color of pure gold. Why all this was so,
    even Hans Pfifendrummel cannot tell, though he has read many
    books and one over.</p>

    <p>The first sister and the second sister dressed in their
    Sunday clothes every day, and sat in the sun doing nothing,
    just as though they had been born ladies, both of them.</p>

    <p><!-- Page 136 --><a name="Page_136"
       id="Page_136"></a>As for Christine&mdash;that was the name
       of the youngest girl&mdash;as for Christine, she dressed in
       nothing but rags, and had to drive the geese to the hills in
       the morning and home again in the evening, so that they
       might feed on the young grass all day and grow fat.</p>

    <p>The first sister and the second sister had white bread (and
    butter beside) and as much fresh milk as they could drink; but
    Christine had to eat cheese-parings and bread-crusts, and had
    hardly enough of them to keep Goodman Hunger from whispering in
    her ear.</p>

    <p>This was how the churn clacked in that house!</p>

    <p>Well, one morning Christine started off to the hills with
    her flock of geese, and in her hands she carried her knitting,
    at which she worked to save time. So she went along the dusty
    road until, by-and-by, she came to a place where a bridge
    crossed the brook, and what should she see there but a little
    red cap, with a silver bell at the point of it, hanging from
    the alder branch. It was such a nice, pretty little red cap
    that Christine thought that she would take it home with her,
    for she had never seen the like of it in all of her life
    before.</p>

    <p>So she put it in her pocket, and then off she went with her
    geese again. But she had hardly gone two-score of paces when
    she heard a voice calling her, "Christine! Christine!"</p>

    <p>She looked, and who should she see but a queer little gray
    man, with a great head as big as a cabbage and little legs as
    thin as young radishes.</p>

    <p>"What do you want?" said Christine, when the little man had
    come to where she was.</p>

    <p>Oh, the little man only wanted his cap again, for
    <!-- Page 137 --><a name="Page_137"
       id="Page_137"></a>without it he could not go back home into
       the hill&mdash;that was where he belonged.</p>

    <p>But how did the cap come to be hanging from the bush? Yes,
    Christine would like to know that before she gave it back
    again.</p><br>


    <div class="ctr">
        <a id="cap"></a> <a href=

             alt="The little man asks far his cap."
             title="The little man asks far his cap."></a>

        <p class="caption">"The little man asks far his cap."</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>Well, the little hill-man was fishing by the brook over
    yonder when a puff of wind blew his cap into the water, and he
    just hung it up to dry. That was all that there was about it;
    and now would Christine please give it to him?</p>

    <p>Christine did not know how about that; perhaps she would and
    perhaps she would not. It was a nice, pretty little cap; what
    would the little underground man give her for it? that was the
    question.</p>

    <p><!-- Page 138 --><a name="Page_138"
       id="Page_138"></a>Oh, the little man would give her five
       thalers for it, and gladly.</p>

    <p>No; five thalers was not enough for such a pretty little
    cap&mdash;see, there was a silver bell hanging to it too.</p>

    <p>Well, the little man did not want to be hard at a bargain;
    he would give her a hundred thalers for it.</p>

    <p>No; Christine did not care for money. What else would he
    give for this nice, dear little cap?</p>

    <p>"See, Christine," said the little man, "I will give you this
    for the cap"; and he showed her something in his hand that
    looked just like a bean, only it was as black as a lump of
    coal.</p>

    <p>"Yes, good; but what is that?" said Christine.</p>

    <p>"That," said the little man, "is a seed from the apple of
    contentment. Plant it, and from it will grow a tree, and from
    the tree an apple. Everybody in the world that sees the apple
    will long for it, but nobody in the world can pluck it but you.
    It will always be meat and drink to you when you are hungry,
    and warm clothes to your back when you are cold. Moreover, as
    soon as you pluck it from the tree, another as good will grow
    in its place. <i>Now</i>, will you give me my hat?"</p>

    <p>Oh yes; Christine would give the little man his cap for such
    a seed as that, and gladly enough. So the little man gave
    Christine the seed, and Christine gave the little man his cap
    again. He put the cap on his head, and&mdash;puff!&mdash;away
    he was gone, as suddenly as the light of a candle when you blow
    it out.</p>

    <p>So Christine took the seed home with her, and planted it
    before the window of her room. The next morning when she looked
    out of the window she beheld a beautiful
    <!-- Page 139 --><a name="Page_139"
       id="Page_139"></a>tree, and on the tree hung an apple that
       shone in the sun as though it were pure gold. Then she went
       to the tree and plucked the apple as easily as though it
       were a gooseberry, and as soon as she had plucked it another
       as good grew in its place. Being hungry she ate it, and
       thought that she had never eaten anything as good, for it
       tasted like pancake with honey and milk.</p><br>

        <p class="caption">"Christine and the Apple"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>By-and-by the oldest sister came out of the house and looked
    around, but when she saw the beautiful tree with the golden
    apple hanging from it you can guess how she stared.</p>

    <p>Presently she began to long and long for the apple as she
    had never longed for anything in her life. "I will just pluck
    it," said she, "and no one will be the wiser for it." But that
    was easier said than done. She reached and reached, but she
    might as well have reached for the moon; she climbed and
    climbed, but she might as well <!-- Page 140 --><a name=
    "Page_140"
       id="Page_140"></a>have climbed for the sun&mdash;for either
       one would have been as easy to get as that which she wanted.
       At last she had to give up trying for it, and her temper was
       none the sweeter for that, you may be sure.</p><br>


    <div class="ctr">
        <a id="Mother_and_Sisters"></a> <a href=

        <p class="caption">"Christine's Mother and Sisters wish for
        the Apple."</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>After a while came the second sister, and when she saw the
    golden apple she wanted it just as much as the first had done.
    But to want and to get are very different things, as she soon
    found, for she was no more able to get it than the other had
    been.</p>

    <p>Last of all came the mother, and she also strove to pluck
    the apple. But it was no use. She had no more luck of her
    trying than her daughters; all that the three could do was to
    stand under the tree and look at the apple, and wish for it and
    wish for it.</p>

    <p>They are not the only ones who have done the like, with the
    apple of contentment hanging just above them.</p>

    <p>As for Christine, she had nothing to do but to pluck
    <!-- Page 141 --><a name="Page_141"
       id="Page_141"></a>an apple whenever she wanted it. Was she
       hungry? there was the apple hanging in the tree for her. Was
       she thirsty? there was the apple. Cold? there was the apple.
       So you see, she was the happiest girl betwixt all the seven
       hills that stand at the ends of the earth; for nobody in the
       world can have more than contentment, and that was what the
       apple brought her.</p>

    <p>II</p>

    <p>One day a king came riding along the road, and all of his
    people with him. He looked up and saw the apple hanging in the
    tree, and a great desire came upon him to have a taste of it.
    So he called one of the servants to him, and told him to go and
    ask whether it could be bought for a potful of gold.</p>

    <p>So the servant went to the house, and knocked on the
    door&mdash;rap! tap! tap!</p>

    <p>"What do you want?" said the mother of the three sisters,
    coming to the door.</p>

    <p>Oh, nothing much; only a king was out there in the road, and
    wanted to know if she would sell the apple yonder for a potful
    of gold.</p>

    <p>Yes, the woman would do that. Just pay her the pot of gold
    and he might go and pluck it and welcome.</p>

    <p>So the servant gave her the pot of gold, and then he tried
    to pluck the apple. First he reached for it, and then he
    climbed for it, and then he shook the limb.</p>

    <p>But it was no use for him to try; he could no more get
    it&mdash;well&mdash;than <i>I</i> could if I had been in his
    place.</p>

    <p>At last the servant had to go back to the King. The
    <!-- Page 142 --><a name="Page_142"
       id="Page_142"></a>apple was there, he said, and the woman
       had sold it, but try and try as he would he could no more
       get it than he could get the little stars in the sky.</p>

    <p>Then the King told the steward to go and get it for him; but
    the steward, though he was a tall man and a strong man, could
    no more pluck the apple than the servant.</p><br>


    <div class="ctr">
        <a id="The_King"></a> <a href=
        "images/kingreachesfull.png"><img src=
        "images/kingreachesthumb.png"
             alt="The King reaches for the Apple"
             title="The King reaches for the Apple"></a>

        <p class="caption">"The King reaches for the Apple"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>So he had to go back to the King with an empty fist. No; he
    could not gather it, either.</p>

    <p>Then the King himself went. He knew that he could pluck
    it&mdash;of course he could! Well, he tried and tried; but
    nothing came of his trying, and he had to ride away at last
    without, having had so much as a smell of the apple.</p>

    <p>After the King came home, he talked and dreamed and thought
    of nothing but the apple; for the more he could not get it the
    more he wanted it&mdash;that is the way we are made in this
    world. At last he grew melancholy and sick for want of that
    which he could not get. Then he sent for one who was so wise
    that he had more in his head than ten men together. This wise
    man told him that the only one who could pluck the fruit of
    <!-- Page 143 --><a name="Page_143"
       id="Page_143"></a>contentment for him was the one to whom
       the tree belonged. This was one of the daughters of the
       woman who had sold the apple to him for the pot of gold.</p>

    <p>When the King heard this he was very glad; he had his horse
    saddled, and he and his court rode away, and so came at last to
    the cottage where Christine lived. There they found the mother
    and the elder sisters, for Christine was away on the hills with
    her geese.</p>

    <p>The King took off his hat and made a fine bow.</p>

    <p>The wise man at home had told him this and that; now to
    which one of her daughters did the apple-tree belong? so said
    the King.</p>

    <p>"Oh, it is my oldest daughter who owns the tree," said the
    woman.</p>

    <p>So, good! Then if the oldest daughter would pluck the apple
    for him he would take her home and marry her and make a queen
    of her. Only let her get it for him without delay.</p>

    <p>Prut! that would never do. What! was the girl to climb the
    apple-tree before the King and all of the court? No! no! Let
    the King go home, and she would bring the apple to him all in
    good time; that was what the woman said.</p>

    <p>Well, the King would do that, only let her make haste, for
    he wanted it very much indeed.</p>

    <p>As soon as the King had gone, the woman and her daughters
    sent for the goose-girl to the hills. Then they told her that
    the King wanted the apple yonder, and that she must pluck it
    for her sister to take to him; if she did not do as they said
    they would throw her into the well. So Christine had to pluck
    the fruit; and as soon <!-- Page 144 --><a name="Page_144"
       id="Page_144"></a>as she had done so the oldest sister
       wrapped it up in a napkin and set off with it to the King's
       house, as pleased as pleased could be. Rap! tap! tap! she
       knocked at the door. Had she brought the apple for the
       King?</p>

    <p>Oh yes, she had brought it. Here it was, all wrapped up in a
    fine napkin.</p><br>


    <div class="ctr">
        <a id="King_talks"></a> <a href=
        "images/kingtalksfull.png"><img src=

             title="The King talks with the Wise Man"></a>

        <p class="caption">"The King talks with the Wise Man"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>After that they did not let her stand outside the door till
    her toes were cold, I can tell you. As soon as she had come to
    the King she opened her napkin. Believe me or not as you
    please, all the same, I tell you that there was nothing in the
    napkin but a hard round stone. When the King saw only a stone
    he was so angry that he stamped like a rabbit and told them to
    put the girl out of the house. So they did, and she went home
    with a flea in her ear, I can tell you.</p>

    <p><!-- Page 145 --><a name="Page_145"
       id="Page_145"></a>Then the King sent his steward to the
       house where Christine and her sisters lived.</p>

    <p>He told the woman that he had come to find whether she had
    any other daughters.</p><br>


    <div class="ctr">
        <a id="Steward_and_Christine"></a> <a href=
        "images/kingsstewardfull.png"><img src=

        <p class="caption">"The King's Steward and Christine"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>Yes; the woman had another daughter, and, to tell the truth,
    it was she who owned the tree. Just let the steward go home
    again and the girl would fetch the apple in a little while.</p>

    <p>As soon as the steward had gone, they sent to the hills for
    Christine again. Look! she must pluck the apple
    <!-- Page 146 --><a name="Page_146"
       id="Page_146"></a>for the second sister to take to the King;
       if she did not do that they would throw her into the
       well.</p>

    <p>So Christine had to pluck it, and gave it to the second
    sister, who wrapped it up in a napkin and set off for the
    King's house. But she fared no better than the other, for, when
    she opened the napkin, there was nothing in it but a lump of
    mud. So they packed her home again with her apron to her
    eyes.</p><br>


    <div class="ctr">
        <a id="Apple_to_the_King"></a> <a href=

        <p class="caption">"Christine gives the Apple to the
        King"</p>
    </div><br>


    <p>After a while the King's steward came to the house again.
    Had the woman no other daughter than these two?</p>

    <p>Well, yes, there was one, but she was a poor ragged thing,
    of no account, and fit for nothing in the world but to tend the
    geese.</p>

    <p>Where was she?</p>

    <p>Oh, she was up on the hills now tending her flock.</p>

    <p>But could the steward see her?</p>

    <p><!-- Page 147 --><a name="Page_147"
       id="Page_147"></a>Yes, he might see her, but she was nothing
       but a poor simpleton.</p>

    <p>That was all very good, but the steward would like to see
    her, for that was what the King had sent him there for.</p>

    <p>So there was nothing to do but to send to the hills for
    Christine.</p>

    <p>After a while she came, and the steward asked her if she
    could pluck the apple yonder for the King.</p>

    <p>Yes; Christine could do that easily enough. So she reached
    and picked it as though it had been nothing but a gooseberry on
    the bush. Then the steward took off his hat and made her a low
    bow in spite of her ragged dress, for he saw that she was the
    one for whom they had been looking all this time.</p>

    <p>So Christine slipped the golden apple into her pocket, and
    then she and the steward set off to the King's house
    together.</p>

    <p>When they had come there everybody began to titter and laugh
    behind the palms of their hands to see what a poor ragged
    goose-girl the steward had brought home with him. But for that
    the steward cared not a rap.</p>

    <p>"Have you brought the apple?" said the King, as soon as
    Christine had come before him.</p>

    <p>Yes; here it was; and Christine thrust her hand into her
    pocket and brought it forth. Then the King took a great bite of
    it, and as soon as he had done so he looked at Christine and
    thought that he had never seen such a pretty girl. As for her
    rags, he minded them no more than one minds the spots on a
    cherry; that was because he had eaten of the apple of
    contentment.</p>

    <p><!-- Page 148 --><a name="Page_148"
       id="Page_148"></a>And were they married? Of course they
       were! and a grand wedding it was, I can tell you. It is a
       pity that you were not there; but though you were not,
       Christine's mother and sisters were, and, what is more, they
       danced with the others, though I believe they would rather
       have danced upon pins and needles.</p>

    <p>"Never mind," said they; "we still have the apple of
    contentment at home, though we cannot taste of it." But no;
    they had nothing of the kind. The next morning it stood before
    the young Queen Christine's window, just as it had at her old
    home, for it belonged to her and to no one else in all of the
    world. That was lucky for the King, for he needed a taste of it
    now and then as much as anybody else, and no one could pluck it
    for him but Christine.</p>

    <p class="center">Now, that is all of this story. What does
    it<br>
     mean? Can you not see? Prut! rub<br>
     your spectacles and look again!</p><br>
     <br>

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
